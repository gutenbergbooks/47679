<h2>AMPHITRYON.</h2>


<p>Plautus, the venerable father of Roman comedy, who flourished
during the second Punic war, left us a play on the subject
of Amphitryon, which has had the honour to be deemed worthy
of imitation by Moliere and Dryden. It cannot be expected, that
the plain, blunt, and inartificial stile of so rude an age should bear
any comparison with that of authors who enjoyed the highest
advantages of the polished times, to which they were an ornament.
But the merit of having devised and embodied most of the comic
distresses, which have excited laughter throughout so many ages,
is to be attributed to the ancient bard, upon whose original conception
of the plot his successors have made few and inconsiderable
improvements. It is true, that, instead of a formal <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Prologus</i>,
who stepped forth, in the character of Mercury, and gravely detailed
to the audience the plot of the play, Moliere and Dryden
have introduced it in the modern more artificial method, by the
dialogue of the actors in the first scene. It is true, also, that with great
contempt of one of the unities, afterwards deemed so indispensible
by the ancients, Plautus introduces the birth of Hercules into a
play, founded upon the intrigue which occasioned that event. Yet
with all these disadvantages, and that of the rude flatness of his
dialogue,&mdash;resting frequently, for wit, upon the most miserable
puns,&mdash;the comic device of the two Sosias; the errors into which
the malice of Mercury plunges his unlucky original; the quarrel
of Alcmena with her real husband, and her reconciliation with Jupiter
in his stead; the final confronting of the two Amphitryos;
and the astonishment of the unfortunate general, at finding every
proof of his identity exhibited by his rival,&mdash;are all, however rudely
sketched, the inventions of the Roman poet. In one respect it
would seem, that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeu de theatre</i>, necessary to render the piece
probable upon the stage, was better managed in the time of Plautus
than in that of Dryden and Moliere. Upon a modern stage it
is evidently difficult to introduce two pair of characters, so extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
alike as to make it at all probable, or even possible, that the
mistakes, depending upon their extreme resemblance, could take
place. But, favoured by the masks and costume of the ancient
theatre, Plautus contrived to render Jupiter and Mercury so exactly
like Amphitryon and Sosia, that they were obliged to retain
certain marks, supposed to be invisible to the other persons of the
drama, by which the audience themselves might be enabled to distinguish
the gods from the mortals, whose forms they had assumed<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>The modern poets have treated the subject, which they had from
Plautus, each according to the fashion of his country; and so far
did the correctness of the French stage exceed ours at that period,
that the palm of the comic writing must be, at once, awarded to
Moliere. For, though Dryden had the advantage of the French
author's labours, from which, and from Plautus, he has translated
liberally, the wretched taste of the age has induced him to lard
the piece with gratuitous indelicacy. He is, in general, coarse and
vulgar, where Moliere is witty; and where the Frenchman ventures
upon a double meaning, the Englishman always contrives to
make it a single one. Yet although inferior to Moliere, and accommodated
to the gross taste of the seventeenth century, "Amphitryon"
is one of the happiest effusions of Dryden's comic muse.
He has enriched the plot by the intrigue of Mercury and Ph√¶dra;
and the petulant interested "Queen of Gipsies," as her lover terms
her, is no bad paramour for the God of Thieves.</p>

<p>In the scenes of a higher cast, Dryden far outstrips both the
French and Roman poet. The sensation to be expressed is not
that of sentimental affection, which the good father of Olympus
was not capable of feeling; but love, of that grosser and subordinate
kind which prompted Jupiter in his intrigues, has been by
none of the ancient poets expressed in more beautiful verse than
that in which Dryden has clothed it, in the scenes between Jupiter
and Alcmena. Even Milbourne, who afterwards attacked our
author with such malignant asperity, was so sensible of the merit
of "Amphitryon," that he addressed to the publisher the following
letter and copy of verses, which Mr Malone's industry recovered
from among Mr Tonson's papers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Mr Tonson</span>, <span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Yarmouth, Novemb. 24.&mdash;90.</i></span></p></blockquote>

<p>"You'l wonder perhaps at this from a stranger; but ye reason
of it may perhaps abate somewhat of ye miracle, and it's this. On
Thursday the twentyth instant, I receiv'd Mr Drydens <span class="smcap">Amphytrio</span>:
I leave out the Greeke termination, as not so proper in
my opinion, in English. But to passe that; I liked the play, and
read it over with as much of criticisme and ill nature as ye time
(being about one in ye morning, and in bed,) would permit. Going
to sleep very well pleasd, I could not leave my bed in ye morning
without this sacrifice to the authours genius: it was too sudden
to be correct, but it was very honestly meant, and is submitted
to yours and Mr Ds. disposall.</p>

  <div class="i2">Still smooth, as when, adorn'd with youthful pride,</div>

<p>Milbourne concludes, by desiring to be supplied with such of
our author's writings, as he had not already, to be sent to Yarmouth
in Norfolk, where he probably had then a living.</p>

<p>"Amphitryon" was produced in the same year with "Don Sebastian;"
and although it cannot be called altogether an original
performance, yet it contains so much original writing as to shew,
that our author's vein of poetry was, in his advanced age, distinguished
by the same rapid fluency, as when he first began to write
for the stage.</p>

<p>This comedy was acted and printed in 1690. It was very favourably
received; and continued long to be what is called a stock-play.</p>

exercised on an enemy, had certainly been a point of honour, and as such
I might have justly recommended it to the world; but that of constancy to
your former choice, and the pursuance of your first favours, are virtues
not over-common amongst Englishmen. All things of honour have, at best,
somewhat of ostentation in them, and self-love; there is a pride of doing
more than is expected from us, and more than others would have done. But
to proceed in the same track of goodness, favour, and protection, is to
shew that a man is acted by a thorough principle: it carries somewhat of
tenderness in it, which is humanity in a heroical degree; it is a kind
of unmoveable good-nature; a word which is commonly despised, because it
is so seldom practised. But, after all, it is the most generous virtue,
opposed to the most degenerate vice, which is that of ruggedness and
harshness to our fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>It is upon this knowledge of you, sir, that I have chosen you, with
your permission, to be the patron of this poem. And as, since this
wonderful Revolution, I have begun with the best pattern of humanity, the
Earl of Leicester, I shall continue to follow the same method, in all to
whom I shall address; and endeavour to pitch on such only, as have been
pleased to own me, in this ruin of my small fortune; who, though they are
of a contrary opinion themselves, yet blame not me for adhering to a lost
cause; and judging for myself, what I cannot
chuse but judge, so long as I am a patient sufferer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and no disturber of the government. Which, if it be a severe penance, as
a great wit has told the world, it is at least enjoined me by myself: and
Sancho Pan√ßa, as much fool as I, was observed to discipline his body no
farther than he found he could endure the smart.</p>

<p>You see, sir, I am not entertaining you like Ovid, with a lamentable
epistle from Pontus: I suffer no more than I can easily undergo; and so
long as I enjoy my liberty, which is the birth-right of an Englishman,
the rest shall never go near my heart. The merry philosopher is more to
my humour than the melancholic; and I find no disposition in myself to
cry, while the mad world is daily supplying me with such occasions of
laughter. The more reasonable sort of my countrymen have shewn so much
favour to this piece, that they give me no doubt of their protection for
the future.</p>

<p>As you, sir, have been pleased to follow the example of their
goodness, in favouring me; so give me leave to say that I follow yours,
in this dedication to a person of a different persuasion. Though I must
confess withal, that I have had a former encouragement from you for this
address; and the warm remembrance of your noble hospitality to me,
at Trentham<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, when some years ago I visited my
friends and relations in your country, has ever since given me a violent
temptation to this boldness.</p>

<p>It is true, were this comedy wholly mine, I should call it a trifle,
and perhaps not think it worth your patronage; but, when the names of
Plautus and Moliere are joined in it, that is, the two greatest
names of ancient and modern comedy, I must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
presume so far on their reputation, to think their best and most
unquestioned productions can be termed little. I will not give you the
trouble of acquainting you what I have added, or altered, in either of
them, so much, it may be, for the worse; but only, that the difference
of our stage, from the Roman and the French, did so require it. But I
am afraid, for my own interest, the world will too easily discover,
that more than half of it is mine; and that the rest is rather a lame
imitation of their excellencies, than a just translation. It is enough,
that the reader know by you, that I neither deserve nor desire any
applause from it: if I have performed any thing, it is the genius of my
authors that inspired me; and, if it pleased in representation let the
actors share the praise amongst themselves. As for Plautus and Moliere,
they are dangerous people; and I am too weak a gamester to put myself
into their form of play. But what has been wanting on my part, has been
abundantly supplied by the excellent composition of Mr Purcell; in whose
person we have at length found an Englishman, equal with the best abroad.
At least, my opinion of him has been such, since his happy and
judicious performances in the late opera<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, and the
experience I have had of him, in the setting my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
three songs for this "Amphitryon:" to all which, and particularly to
the composition of the pastoral dialogue, the numerous choir of fair
ladies gave so just an applause on the third day. I am only sorry,
for my own sake, that there was one star wanting, as beautiful as
any in our hemisphere; that young Berenice<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
who is misemploying all her charms on stupid country souls, that can
never know the value of them; and losing the triumphs, which are ready
prepared for her, in the court and town. And yet I know not whether I
am so much a loser by her absence; for I have reason to apprehend the
sharpness of her judgment, if it were not allayed with the sweetness of
her nature; and, after all, I fear she may come time enough to discover
a thousand imperfections in my play, which might have passed on vulgar
understandings. Be pleased to use the authority of a father over her,
on my behalf: enjoin her to keep her own thoughts of "Amphitryon" to
herself; or at least not to compare him too strictly with Moliere's. It
is true, I have an interest in this partiality of hers: but withal, I
plead some sort of merit for it, in being so particularly, as I am,</p>

 <div class="text width35">
<p>I have discharged my duty, which was, to summon you, Ph&oelig;bus:
we shall know more anon, when the Thunderer comes down. 'Tis our part
to obey our father; for, to confess the truth, we two are little better
than sons of harlots; and, if Jupiter had not been pleased to take a
little pains with our mothers, instead of being gods, we might have been
a couple of link-boys.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Ph&oelig;.</i> But know you nothing farther, Hermes? What news in
court?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> There has been a devilish quarrel, I can tell you, between
Jupiter and Juno. She threatened to sue him in the spiritual court for
some matrimonial omissions; and he stood upon his prerogative: then she
hit him in the teeth of all his bastards; and your name and mine were
used with less reverence than became our godships. They were both in
their cups; and at last the matter grew so high, that they were ready to
have thrown stars at one another's heads.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Ph&oelig;.</i> 'Twas happy for me that I was at my vocation, driving
day-light about the world. But I had rather stand my father's
thunderbolts, than my stepmother's railing.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> When the tongue-battle was over, and the championess had
harnessed her peacocks to go for Samos, and hear the prayers that were
made to her&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Ph&oelig;.</i> By the way, her worshippers had a bad time on't; she was
in a damnable humour for receiving petitions.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Jupiter immediately beckons me aside, and charges me, that, as
soon as ever you had set up your horses, you and I should meet him here
at Thebes: Now, putting the premises together, as dark as it is, methinks
I begin to see day-light.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Ph&oelig;.</i> As plain as one of my own beams; she has
made him uneasy at home, and he is going to seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
his diversion abroad. I see heaven itself is no privileged place for
happiness, if a man must carry his wife along with him.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> 'Tis neither better nor worse, upon my conscience. He is weary
of hunting in the spacious forest of a wife, and is following his game
<em>incognito</em> in some little purlieu here at Thebes: that's many an honest
man's case on earth too, Jove help them! as indeed he does, to make them
cuckolds.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Ph&oelig;.</i> But, if so, Mercury, then I, who am a poet, must indite
his love-letter; and you, who are by trade a porter, must convey it.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> No more; he's coming down souse upon us, and hears as far as
he can see too. He's plaguy hot upon the business, I know it by his hard
driving.</p>

<p>Merc. <span class="stage">[<i>To Night.</i>]</span> Madam Night, a good
even to you! Fair and softly, I beseech you, madam; I have a word or two
to you from no less a god than Jupiter.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Night.</i> O my nimble-fingered god of theft, what makes you here on
earth at this unseasonable hour? What banker's shop is to be broke open
to-night? or what clippers, and coiners, and conspirators, have been
invoking your deity for their assistance?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Faith, none of those enormities, and yet I am still in my
vocation; for you know I am a jack of all trades. At a word, Jupiter is
indulging his genius to-night with a certain noble sort of recreation;
called wenching; the truth on't is, adultery is its proper name.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Night.</i> Jupiter would do well to stick to his wife, Juno.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> He has been married to her above these hundred years; and
that's long enough, in conscience, to stick to one woman.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Night.</i> She's his sister too, as well as his wife; that's a double
tie of affection to her.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Nay, if he made bold with his own flesh and blood, 'tis likely
he will not spare his neighbours.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Night.</i> If I were his wife, I would raise a rebellion against him,
for the violation of my bed.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Thou art mistaken, old Night; his wife could raise no faction.
All the deities in heaven would take the part of the cuckold-making
god, for they are all given to the flesh most damnably. Nay, the very
goddesses would stickle in the cause of love; 'tis the way to be popular,
to whore and love. For what dost thou think old Saturn was deposed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
but that he was cold and impotent, and made no court to the fair ladies?
Pallas and Juno themselves, as chaste as they are, cried, <em>Shame on
him!</em>&mdash;I say unto thee, old Night, woe be to the monarch that
has not the women on his side!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Night.</i> Then, by your rule, Mercury, a king who would live happily,
must debauch his whole nation of women.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> As far as his ready money will go, I mean; for Jupiter himself
can't please all of them.&mdash;But this is beside my present commission:
He has sent me to will and require you to make a swinging long night for
him, for he hates to be stinted in his pleasures.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Night.</i> Tell him plainly, I'll rather lay down my commission. What,
would he make a bawd of me?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Poor ignorant! why he meant thee for a bawd, when he first
made thee. What art thou good for, but to be a bawd? Is not day-light
better for mankind, I mean as to any other use, but only for love and
fornication? Thou hast been a bawd too, a reverend, primitive, original
bawd, from the first hour of thy creation; and all the laudable actions
of love have been committed under thy mantle. Pr'ythee, for what dost
thou think that thou art worshipped?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Night.</i> Why, for my stars and moonshine.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> That is, for holding a candle to iniquity. But if they were
put out, thou would'st be doubly worshipped by the willing bashful
virgins.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Night.</i> Then, for my quiet, and the sweetness of my sleep.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> No:&mdash;For thy sweet waking all the night; for sleep comes
not upon lovers, till thou art vanished.</p>

that, whatever work is made, I see nothing.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> About your business then. Put a spoke into your

something against a rainy day, called the day of marriage; every one in

<p><i class="personae">Ph√¶d.</i> Why, he is victorious: indeed I prayed devoutly to Jupiter for
a victory; by the same token, that you should give me ten pieces of gold
if I brought you news of it.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Alc.</i> They are thine, supposing he be safe too.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Ph√¶d.</i> Nay, that's a new bargain, for I vowed to Jupiter, that then
you should give me ten pieces more; but I do undertake for my lord's
safety, if you will please to discharge his godship Jupiter of the debt,
and take it upon you to pay.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Alc.</i> When he returns in safety, Jupiter and I will pay your vow.</p>

<span class="smallish">SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Night Scene of a Palace</i>.</span></h3>

<div class="container">
 <div class="text width35">
<p class="stagecenter"><span class="smcap">Sosia,</span> <i>with a Dark-Lanthorn</i>; <span class="smcap">Mercury</span>, <i>in</i> <span class="smcap">Sosia's</span> <i>shape,</i><br />
<i>with a Dark-Lanthorn also</i>.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Was not the devil in my master, to send me out this dreadful
dark night, to bring the news of his victory to my lady? and was not I
possessed with ten devils, for going on his errand, without a convoy for
the safeguard of my person? Lord, how am I melted into sweat with fear!
I am diminished of my natural weight, above two stone: I shall not bring
half myself home again, to my poor wife and family; I have been in an
ague fit, ever since shut of evening; what with the fright of trees by
the highway, which looked maliciously, like thieves, by moonshine; and
what with bulrushes by the river-side, that shaked like spears and lances
at me. Well, the greatest plague of a serving-man, is to be hired to some
great lord! They care not what drudgery they put upon us, while they lie
lolling at their ease a-bed, and stretch their lazy limbs, in expectation
of the whore which we are fetching for them.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> He is but a poor mortal, that
suffers this; but I, who am a god, am degraded to
a foot-pimp; a waiter without doors! a very civil
employment for a deity!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> The better sort of them will say, "Upon my honour," at every
word; yet ask them for our wages, and they plead the privilege of their
honour, and will not pay us; nor let us take our privilege of the law
upon them. These are a very hopeful sort of patriots, to stand up, as
they do, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
liberty and property of the subject: There's conscience for you!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> This fellow has something of the republican
spirit in him.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Looking about him.</i>]</span> Stay; this, methinks, should be
our house; and I should thank the gods now for bringing me safe home:
but, I think, I had as good let my devotions alone, till I have got the
reward for my good news, and then thank them once for all; for, if I
praise them before I am safe within doors, some damned mastiff dog may
come out and worry me; and then my thanks are thrown away upon them.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> Thou art a wicked rogue, and wilt have thy
bargain beforehand; therefore thou get'st not into the house this night;
and thank me accordingly as I use thee.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Now am I to give my lady an account of my lord's victory; 'tis
good to exercise my parts beforehand, and file my tongue into eloquent
expressions, to tickle her ladyship's imagination.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> Good! and here's the god of eloquence to
judge of thy oration.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Setting down his Lanthorn.</i>]</span> This lanthorn, for
once, shall be my lady; because she is the lamp of all beauty and
perfection.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> No, rogue! 'tis thy lord is the lanthorn by
this time, or Jupiter is turned fumbler.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Then thus I make my addresses to her:&mdash;<span class="stage">[<i>Bows.</i>]</span>
Madam, my lord has chosen me out, as the most faithful, though the most
unworthy, of his followers, to bring your ladyship this following account
of our glorious expedition. Then she,&mdash;O my poor Sosia, <span class="stageone">[<i>In a shrill tone.</i>]</span>
how am I overjoyed to see thee! She can say no
less.&mdash;Madam, you do me too much honour, and the world will
envy me this glory:&mdash;Well answered on my side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
And how does my lord Amphitryon?&mdash;Madam, he always does like a man
of courage, when he is called by honour.&mdash;There I think I nicked
it.&mdash;But when will he return?&mdash;As soon as possibly he can; but
not so soon as his impatient heart could wish him with your ladyship.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> When Thebes is an university, thou deservest
to be their orator.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> But what does he do, and what does he say? Pr'ythee tell me
something more of him.&mdash;He always says less than he does, madam;
and his enemies have found it to their cost.&mdash;Where the devil did I
learn these elegancies and gallantries!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> So, he has all the natural endowments of a fop, and only wants
the education.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Staring up to the sky.</i>]</span> What, is the devil in
the night! She's as long as two nights. The seven stars are just where
they were seven hours ago! high day&mdash;high night, I mean, by my
favour. What, has Ph&oelig;bus been playing the good fellow, and
overslept himself, that he forgets his duty to us mortals!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> How familiarly the rascal treats us gods! but I shall make him
alter his tone immediately.</p>

<p class="stagecenter">[<span class="smcap">Mercury</span> <i>comes nearer, and stands just before him</i>.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Seeing him, and starting back, aside.</i>]</span> How
now? what, do my eyes dazzle, or is my dark lanthorn false to me! is not
that a giant before our door? or a ghost of somebody slain in the late
battle? If he be, 'tis unconscionably done, to fright an honest man thus,
who never drew weapon wrathfully in all my life. Whatever wight he be, I
am devilishly afraid, that's certain; but, 'tis discretion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to keep my own counsel; I'll sing, that I may seem valiant.</p>

<p class="stagecenter">[<span class="smcap">Sosia</span> <i>sings; and</i>, <i>as</i> <span class="smcap">Mercury</span> <i>speaks</i>,<br />
<i>by little and little drops his voice</i>.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> What saucy companion is this, that deafens us with his hoarse
voice? What midnight ballad-singer have we here? I shall teach the
villain to leave off catterwauling.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I would I had courage, for his sake, that I might teach him
to call my singing catterwauling! an illiterate rogue! an enemy to the
muses, and to music.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> There is an ill savour that offends my nostrils and it wafteth
this way.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> He has smelt me out; my fear has betrayed me into this savour.
I am a dead man: the bloody villain is at his fee, fa, fum, already.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Stand, who goes there?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> A friend.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> What friend?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Why, a friend to all the world, that will give me leave to live
peaceably.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> I defy peace and all its works; my arms are out of exercise,
they have mauled nobody these three days: I long for an honourable
occasion to pound a man, and lay him asleep at the first buffet.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> That would almost do me a kindness;
for I have been kept waking, without tipping
one wink of sleep, these three nights.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Of what quality are you, fellow?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Why, I am a man, fellow.&mdash;Courage, Sosia!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> What kind of man?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Why, a two-legged man; what man should I be? <span class="stageone">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span>
I must bear up to him, he may prove as arrant a milksop as myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Thou art a coward, I warrant thee; do not I hear thy teeth
chatter in thy head?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Ay, ay; that's only a sign they would be snapping at thy nose.
<span class="stageone">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> Bless me, what an arm and fist he has, with great
thumbs too; and golls and knuckle-bones of a very butcher!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Sirrah, from whence came you, and whither go you; answer me
directly, upon pain of assassination.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I am coming from whence I came, and am going whither I
go,&mdash;that's directly home; though this is somewhat an uncivil manner
of proceeding, at the first sight of a man, let me tell you.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Then, to begin our better acquaintance, let me first make you
a small present of this box o' the ear&mdash;&mdash; <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Strikes him.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> If I were as choleric a fool as you are now, here would be fine
work betwixt us two; but I am a little better bred, than to disturb the
sleeping neighbourhood; and so good-night, friend&mdash;&mdash; <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Is going.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Stopping him.</i>]</span> Hold, sir; you and I must not part so
easily; once more, whither are you going?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Why I am going as fast as I can, to get out of the reach of
your clutches. Let me but only knock at the door there.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> What business have you at that door, sirrah?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> This is our house; and, when I am got in, I will tell you
more.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Whose house is this, sauciness, that you are so familiar with,
to call it ours?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> 'Tis mine, in the first place; and next, my master's; for I lie
in the garret, and he lies under me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Have your master and you no names, sirrah?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> His name is Amphitryon; hear that, and tremble.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> What, my lord general?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> O, has his name mollified you! I have brought you down a peg
lower already, friend.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> And your name is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Lord, friend, you are so very troublesome&mdash;what should my
name be, but Sosia?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> How, Sosia, say you? how long have you taken up that name,
sirrah?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Here's a fine question! Why I never took it up, friend; it was
born with me.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> What, was your name born Sosia? take this remembrance for that
lie. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Beats him.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Hold, friend! you are so very flippant with your hands, you
won't hear reason: What offence has my name done you, that you should
beat me for it? <em>S. O. S. I. A.</em> they are as civil, honest,
harmless letters, as any are in the whole alphabet.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> I have no quarrel to the name; but that 'tis e'en too good for
you, and 'tis none of yours.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> What, am not I Sosia, say you?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> No.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I should think you are somewhat merrily disposed, if you had
not beaten me in such sober sadness. You would persuade me out of my
heathen name, would you?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Say you are Sosia again, at your peril, sirrah.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I dare say nothing, but thought is free; but whatever I am
called, I am Amphitryon's man, and the first letter of my name is
<em>S.</em> too. You had best tell me that my master did not send me home
to my lady, with news of his victory?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> I say, he did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Lord, Lord, friend, one of us two is horribly given to lying;
but I do not say which of us, to avoid contention.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> I say my name is Sosia, and yours is not.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I would you could make good your words; for then I should not
be beaten, and you should.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> I find you would be Sosia, if you durst; but if I catch you
thinking so&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I hope I may think I was Sosia; and I can find no difference
between my former self, and my present self, but that I was plain Sosia
before, and now I am laced Sosia.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Take this, for being so impudent to think so. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Beats him.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Kneeling.</i>]</span> Truce a little, I beseech thee! I
would be a stock or a stone now by my good will, and would not think
at all, for self-preservation. But will you give me leave to argue the
matter fairly with you, and promise me to depose that cudgel, if I can
prove myself to be that man that I was before I was beaten?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Well, proceed in safety; I promise you I will not beat you.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> In the first place, then, is not this town called Thebes?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Undoubtedly.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> And is not this house Amphitryon's?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Who denies it?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I thought you would have denied that too; for all hang upon a
string. Remember then, that those two preliminary articles are already
granted. In the next place, did not the aforesaid Amphitryon beat the
Teleboans, kill their king Pterelas, and send a certain servant, meaning
somebody, that for sake-sake shall be nameless, to bring a present to
his wife, with news of his victory, and of his resolution to return
to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> This is all true, to a very tittle; but who is that certain
servant? there's all the question.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Is it peace or war betwixt us?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Peace.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I dare not wholly trust that abominable cudgel; but 'tis a
certain friend of yours and mine, that had a certain name before he was
beaten out of it; but if you are a man that depend not altogether upon
force and brutality, but somewhat also upon reason, now do you bring
better proofs, that you are that same certain man; and, in order to it,
answer me to certain questions.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> I say I am Sosia, Amphitryon's man; what reason have you to
urge against it?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> What was your father's name?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Davus; who was an honest husbandman, whose sister's name was
Harpage, that was married, and died in a foreign country.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> So far you are right, I must confess; and your wife's name
is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> Bromia, a devilish shrew of her tongue, and a vixen of her
hands, that leads me a miserable life; keeps me to hard duty a-bed; and
beats me every morning when I have risen from her side, without having
first&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I understand you, by many a sorrowful token;&mdash;this must be
I. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> I was once taken upon suspicion of burglary, and was whipt
through Thebes, and branded for my pains.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Right, me again; but if you are I, as I begin to suspect, that
whipping and branding might have been past over in silence, for both our
credits. And yet now I think on't, if I am I, (as I am I) he cannot be I.
All these circumstances he might have heard; but I will now interrogate
him upon some private passages.&mdash;What was the present that Amphitryon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
sent by you or me, no matter which of us, to his wife Alcmena?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> A buckle of diamonds, consisting of five large stones.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> And where are they now?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> In a case, sealed with my master's coat of arms.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> This is prodigious, I confess; but yet 'tis nothing, now
I think on't; for some false brother may have revealed it to him.
<span class="stageone">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> But I have another question to ask you, of somewhat
that passed only betwixt myself and me;&mdash;if you are Sosia, what were
you doing in the heat of battle?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> What a wise man should, that has respect for his own person. I
ran into our tent, and hid myself amongst the baggage.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> Such another cutting answer; and I must
provide myself of another name.&mdash;<span class="stageone">[<i>To him.</i>]</span> And how did
you pass your time in that same tent? You need not answer to every
circumstance so exactly now; you must lie a little, that I may think you
the more me.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> That cunning shall not serve your turn, to circumvent me out
of my name: I am for plain naked truth. There stood a hogshead of old
wine, which my lord reserved for his own drinking&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> O the devil! as sure as death, he must have
hid himself in that hogshead, or he could never have known that!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> And by that hogshead, upon the ground, there lay the kind
inviter and provoker of good drinking&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Nay, now I have caught you; there was neither inviter, nor
provoker, for I was all alone.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> A lusty gammon of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Sighing.</i>]</span> Bacon!&mdash;that word has quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
made an end of me.&mdash;Let me see&mdash;this must be I,
in spite of me; but let me view him nearer.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Walks about</i> <span class="smcap">Mercury</span> <i>with his Dark Lanthorn</i>.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> What are you walking about me for, with
your dark lanthorn?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> No harm, friend; I am only surveying a parcel of earth here,
that I find we two are about to bargain for:&mdash;He's damnable like me,
that's certain. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Imprimis</i>, there's the patch upon my nose, with
a pox to him. <em>Item</em>, A very foolish face, with a long chin at
end on't. <em>Item</em>, One pair of shambling legs, with two splay feet
belonging to them; and, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">summa totallis</i>, from
head to foot all my bodily apparel. <span class="stageone">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mercury</span>.]</span>
Well, you are Sosia; there's no denying it:&mdash;but what am I then? for
my mind gives me, I am somebody still, if I knew but who I were.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> When I have a mind to be Sosia no more, then thou may'st be
Sosia again.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I have but one request more to thee; that, though not as Sosia,
yet as a stranger, I may go into that house, and carry a civil message to
my lady.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Merc.</i> No, sirrah; not being Sosia, you have no message to deliver,
nor no lady in this house.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Thou canst not be so barbarous, to let me lie in the streets
all night, after such a journey, and such a beating; and therefore I am

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I am but a slave, and you are master; and a poor man is always
to lie when a rich man is pleased to contradict him: but, as sure as this
is our house&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> So sure 'tis thy place of execution.&mdash;Thou art not made
for lying neither.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> That's certain; for all my neighbours say I have an honest
face; or else they would never call me cuckold, as they do.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> I mean thou hast not wit enough to make a lie that will hang
together: thou hast set up a trade that thou hast not stock enough to
manage. O that I had but a crab-tree cudgel for thy sake!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> How, a cudgel, said you! the devil take Jupiter for inventing
that hard-hearted, merciless, knobby wood.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> The bitterness is yet to come: thou hast had but a half dose
of it.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I was never good at swallowing physic; and my stomach wambles
at the very thought of it. But, if I must have a second beating, in
conscience let me strip first, that I may show you the black and blue
streaks upon my sides and shoulders. I am sure I suffered them in your
service.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> To what purpose wouldst thou show them?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Why, to the purpose that you may not strike me upon the sore
places; and that, as he beat me the last night cross-ways, so you would
please to beat me long-ways, to make clean work on't, that at least my
skin may look like chequer-work.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> This request is too reasonable to be refused. But, that all
things may be done in order, tell me over again the same story, with all
the circumstances of thy commission, that a blow may follow in due form
for every lie. To repetition, rogue; to repetition.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> No; it shall be all a lie, if you please; and I'll eat my

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Ay, sirrah, now you find you are to be disproved; but 'tis too
late. To repetition, rogue; to repetition.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> With all my heart, to any repetition but the cudgel. But would
you be pleased to answer me one civil question? Am I to use complaisance
to you, as to a great person that will have all things said your own way?
or am I to tell you the naked truth alone, without the ceremony of a
farther beating?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Nothing but the truth, and the whole truth; so help thee,
cudgel!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> That's a damned conclusion of a sentence: but, since it must
be so&mdash;back and sides, at your own peril!&mdash;I set out from
the port in an unlucky hour; the dusky canopy of night enveloping the
hemisphere.&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I stand corrected: In plain prose then,&mdash;I went darkling,
and whistling to keep myself from being afraid; mumbling curses betwixt
my teeth, for being sent at such an unnatural time of night.</p>

your lord and master! take&mdash; <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Going to strike.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Hold, sir&mdash;pray, consider if this be not unreasonable
to strike me for telling the whole truth, when you commanded me: I'll
fall into my old dog-trot of lying again, if this must come of plain
dealing.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> To avoid impertinences make an end of your journey, and come
to the house;&mdash;what found you there, a god's name?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I came thither in no god's name at all, but in the devil's
name; I found before the door a swinging fellow, with all my shapes and
features, and accoutred also in my habit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Who was that fellow?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Who should it be, but another Sosia! a certain kind of other
me: who knew all my unfortunate commission, precisely to a word, as well
as I Sosia; as being sent by yourself from the port upon the same errand
to Alcmena.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> What gross absurdities are these?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> O Lord, O Lord, what absurdities!&mdash;as plain as
any packstaff. That other me had posted himself there before me,
me.&mdash;You won't give a man leave to speak poetically now; or else I
would say, that I was arrived at the door just before I came thither.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> This must either be a dream or drunkenness, or madness in
thee. Leave your buffooning and lying; I am not in humour to bear it,
sirrah.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I would you should know I scorn a lie, and am a man of honour
in every thing but just fighting. I tell you once again, in plain
sincerity and simplicity of heart, that, before last night, I never took
myself but for one single individual Sosia; but, coming to our door, I
found myself, I know not how, divided, and, as it were, split into two
Sosias.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Leave buffooning: I see you would make me laugh, but you play
the fool scurvily.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> That may be; but, if I am a fool, I am not the only fool in
this company.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> How now, impudence! I shall&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Be not in wrath, sir; I meant not you: I cannot possibly be the
only fool; for, if I am one fool, I must certainly be two fools; because,
as I told you, I am double.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> That one should be two, is very probable!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Have you not seen a six-pence split into two halves, by some
ingenious school-boy, which bore on either side the impression of the monarch's face?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Now, as those moieties were two three-pences, and yet in effect but one
six-pence&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> No more of your villainous tropes and figures.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Nay, if an orator must be disarmed of his
similitudes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> A man had need of patience, to endure this gibberish! be
brief, and come to a conclusion.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> What would you have, sir? I came thither, but the t'other I
was before me; for that there was two <em>I</em>'s, is as certain, as
that I have two eyes in this head of mine. This <em>I</em>, that am here,
was weary: the t'other <em>I</em> was fresh; this <em>I</em> was peaceable, and
t'other <em>I</em> was a hectoring bully <em>I</em>.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> And thou expect'st I should believe thee?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> No; I am not so unreasonable; for I could never have believed
it myself, if I had not been well beaten into it: but a cudgel, you know,
is a convincing argument in a brawny fist. What shall I say, but that
I was compelled, at last, to acknowledge myself! I found that he was
very I, without fraud, cozen, or deceit. Besides, I viewed myself, as
in a mirror, from head to foot; he was handsome of a noble presence, a
charming air, loose and free in all his motions; and saw he was so much
I, that I should have reason to be better satisfied with my own person,
if his hands had not been a little of the heaviest.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Once again, to a conclusion: Say you passed by him, and
entered into the house.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I am a friend to truth, and say no such thing; he defended the
door, and I could not enter.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> How, not enter?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Why, how should I enter? unless I were a spirit, to glide by
him, and shoot myself through locks, and bolts, and two-inch boards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> O coward! Didst thou not attempt to pass?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Yes, and was repulsed and beaten for my pains.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Who beat thee?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I beat me.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Didst thou beat thyself?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I don't mean <em>I</em>, here: but the absent <i>Me</i> beat
me here present.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> There's no end of this intricate piece of nonsense.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> 'Tis only nonsense, because I speak it, who am a poor fellow;
but it would be sense, and substantial sense, if a great man said it,
that was backed with a title, and the eloquence of ten thousand pounds
a-year.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Brom.</i> Yes, monstrous kind indeed: You never said a truer word; for,
when I came to kiss you, you pulled away your mouth, and turned your

<p><i class="personae">Brom.</i> But what? How was it discreetly done then? ha!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Because it is the received opinion of physicians, that nothing
but puling chits, and booby-fools are procreated in drunkenness.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Brom.</i> A received opinion, snivel-guts! I'll be judged by all the
married women of this town, if any one of them has received it. The devil
take the physicians for meddling in our matters! If a husband will be
ruled by them, there are five weeks of abstinence in dog-days too; for
fear a child, that was got in August, should be born just nine months
after, and be blear-eyed, like a May kitten.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> To shut the door against me in my very face, to deny me
entrance, to brave me from the balcony, to laugh at me, to threaten
me! what proofs of innocence call you these? but if I punish not this
insolence&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Grip.</i> Now, what hast thou to say for thyself,
Sosia?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> I say, in the first place, be sure you hold
him, gentlemen; for I shall never plead worth one
farthing, while I am bodily afraid.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Do you hear his impudence? yet will you let me go?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> No impudence at all, my lord; for how could I, naturally
speaking, be in the balcony, and affronting you, when at the same time I
was in every street of Thebes, inviting these gentlemen to dinner?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Grip.</i> Hold a little:&mdash;How long since was it that he spoke to
you from the said balcony?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Just now; not a minute before he brought you hither.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Now speak, my witnesses.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Grip.</i> I can answer for him for this last half hour.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Tran.</i> And I.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Now judge equitably, gentlemen, whether I was not a civil
well-bred person, to tell my lord he fibs only?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Who gave you that order, to invite them?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> He that best might,&mdash;yourself: By the same token, you bid
old Bromia provide an' 'twere for a god, and I put in for a brace, or a
leash;&mdash;no, now I think on't, it was for ten couple of gods, to make
sure of plenty.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> When did I give thee this pretended commission?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Why, you gave me this pretended commission, when you were just
ready to give my lady the fiddles, and a dance; in order, as I suppose,
to your second bedding.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Where, in what place, did I give this order?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> Here, in this place, in the presence of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>

justify it.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> O, heaven! These accidents are so surprising, the more I think
of them, the more I am lost in my imagination.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Grip.</i> Nay, he has told us some passages, as he came along, that seem
to surpass the power of nature.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> What think you now, my lord, of a certain twin-brother of mine,
called Sosia? 'Tis a sly youth: pray heaven, you have not just such
another relation within doors, called Amphitryon. It may be it was he
that put upon me, in your likeness; and perhaps he may have put something
upon your lordship too, that may weigh heavy upon the forehead.</p>

<p>Amph. <span class="stage">[<i>To those who hold him.</i>]</span> Let me go; Sosia
may be innocent, and I will not hurt him. Open the door, I'll resolve my
doubts immediately.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Sos.</i> The door is peremptory, that it will not be opened without
keys; and my brother on the inside is in possession, and will not part
with them.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Then 'tis manifest that I am affronted.&mdash;Break open the
door there.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Dost thou take part with my adulteress too, because she is thy
niece?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Grip.</i> I take part with nothing, but the law; and, to break the doors
open, is to break the law.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Amph.</i> Do thou command them then.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Grip.</i> I command nothing without my warrant; and my clerk is not here
to take his fees for drawing it.</p>

beating, and no belly-full. The beating is bad; but the dinner is good.
Now, not to be beaten, is but negatively good; but, not to fill my belly,
is positively bad. Upon the whole matter, my final resolution is, to take

you by the heels, sirrah: this has the appearance of an unlawful bloody

my want of respect to you. You will neither restore the goblet, nor
renounce Ph√¶dra: I offer you the combat; you refuse it; all this is

you, or kick you, at my own arbitrement; and, I suppose, you are too
honourable not to approve of my proceeding.</p>

you please to restore the cup?</p>

<h2>KING ARTHUR.</h2>

<div class="container">
 <div class="text width35">
<p>The Seventeenth century was still familiar with</p>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">&mdash;&mdash;Whate'er resounds,</div>
  <div class="i0">In fable or romance, of Uther's son,</div>
  <div class="i0">Begirt with British and Armoric knights.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Fired by the splendid fictions which romancers had raised on the
basis of Geoffrey of Monmouth and the Welsh traditions, Milton
had designed the exploits of King Arthur for the subject of his
lofty epic strain. What we have lost, in his abandoning the theme,
can only be estimated by the enthusiastic tone into which he always
swells, when he touches upon the "shores of old romance."
The sublime glow of his imagination, which delighted in painting
what was beyond the reach of human experience; the dignity of
his language, formed to express the sentiments of heroes and of
immortals; his powers of describing alike the beautiful and terrible;
above all, the justice with which he conceived and assigned
to each supernatural agent a character as decidedly peculiar, as
lesser poets have given to their human actors, would have sent
him forth to encounter such a subject with gigantic might. Whoever
has ventured, undeterred by their magnitude, upon the old
romances of "Lancelot du Lac," "Sir Tristrem," and others,
founded on the achievements of the Knights of the Round Table,
cannot but remember a thousand striking Gothic incidents, worthy
subjects of the pen of Milton. What would he not have
made of the adventure of the Ruinous Chapel, the Perilous Manor,
the Forbidden Seat, the Dolorous Wound, and many others
susceptible of being described in the most sublime poetry! Even
when that sun had set, Arthur had yet another chance for immortality;
for Dryden repeatedly expressed his intention to found an
epic poem upon his history. Our poet, it may be guessed, was
too much in the trammels of French criticism, to have ventured
upon a style of composition allied to the Gothic romance. His
poem would probably have been formed upon the model of the
ancients, which, although more classical and correct, might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wanted the force, which reality of painting and description never
fails to give to epic narrative. Arthur, in such a poem, would,
like Rinaldo, have reminded us of Achilles; and the sameness of a
copy would have been substituted for the spirit of a characteristic
original. But, had Dryden executed his intended plan, we should
have found picturesque narrative detailed in the most manly
and majestic verse, and interspersed with lessons teaching us to
know human life, maxims proper to guide it, and sentiments
which ought to adorn it. In the Knight's Tale, and in Dryden's
other narrative poems, we see enough to induce us to regret the
sordid negligence, or avarice, which withheld from him the means
of decent support, while employed upon the promised task. But
Arthur, as a sort of counterpoise to his extravagant reputation during
the middle ages, was doomed, in the seventeenth century, to
be reluctantly abandoned by Milton and Dryden; and to be celebrated
by the pen of Blackmore.</p>

<p>It is probable, that, when Dryden abandoned all thoughts of a
larger work, he adapted the intended subject to the following opera,
and converted the Genii of the kingdoms, by whom the supernatural
machinery of the epic was to have been conducted, into the lighter and
simpler device of airy and earthy spirits, whose idea the Rosicrucian
philosophy had long rendered popular and familiar. There is no attempt
to avail himself of any fragments of Arthur's romantic renown. He
is not, in this drama, the formidable possessor of Excalibar, and
the superior of the chivalry of the Round Table; nor is Merlin the
fiend-born necromancer, of whom antiquity related and believed so
many wonders. They are the prince and magician of a beautiful fairy
tale, the story of which, abstracted from the poetry, might have been
written by Madame D'Aunois. At the same time, the obvious advantages of
an appeal to the ancient prejudices, which our author has neglected,
are supplied from the funds of his own genius. The incidents, being
intended more for the purpose of displaying machinery, and introducing
music and dances, than with any reference to the rules of the drama,
are abundantly fantastic and extravagant; but the poet has supported
them with wonderful address. The blindness of Emmeline, and the
innocence with which she expresses her conception of visible objects,
gives her character an interest often wanting in what may be called the
heroine of a play, whose perfections generally raise her so far beyond
mere mortal excellence, as to render superfluous all human sympathy.
The scene in which Emmeline recovers her sight, when well represented,
never fails to excite the most pleasing testimony of interest and
applause. The machinery is simple, and well managed: the language and
ministry of Grimbald, the fierce earthy d√¶mon, are painted with some
touches which arise even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
sublimity. The conception of Philidel, a fallen angel, retaining
some of the hue of heaven, who is touched with repentance, and
not without hope of being finally received, is an idea, so far as I
know, altogether original. Klopstock has since introduced a similar
character into sacred poetry<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. The principal incident in
"King Arthur" is copied, in almost every circumstance, from the
adventures of Rinaldo in the haunted grove on Mount Olivet<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>,
which makes also the subject of an Italian opera.</p>

<p>From what is mentioned in the author's preface, we may conceive
the disadvantages under which "King Arthur" was finally brought
forward. It was written originally for the conclusion of the reign
of Charles II, and the political masque of "Albion and Albanius"
was often rehearsed before him, as the prologue to "King Arthur."
We may therefore conclude, that the piece, as originally
written, had a strong political tendency, and probably abounded
with these ingenious parallels, by which Dryden, with dexterity
far exceeding that of every other writer, could draw, from remote
or distant events, a moral directly applicable to those of his own
time. But the Revolution, while it ruined our author's prospects,
imposed a cautious restraint upon his muse; and therefore, as he
himself states, he was obliged to deprive his play of many beauties,
not to offend the present times, or displease a government by which
he had hitherto been protected, or at least endured. Thus, our
author was obliged to convert an ingenious, and probably highly
poetical political drama, into a mere fairy tale, as totally divested
as possible of any meaning beyond extravagant adventure. How
much the drama must have suffered in this transformation is easy
to judge, from the spirit with which all Dryden's political pieces
are composed; and from recollecting with what reluctance he
must have gone through alterations, that were to deprive the play
of what was intended to have been its principal merit. This is
the disadvantage of which the poet had already complained:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">How can he show his manhood, when you bind him</div>
  <div class="i0">To box, like boys, with one hand tied behind him?</div>
  <div class="i0">This is plain levelling of wit, in which</div>
  <div class="i0">The poor has all the advantage, not the rich.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">The blockhead stands excused for want of sense,</div>
  <div class="i0">And wits turn blockheads in their own defence.</div>
  <div class="i7"><span style="margin-left: 7em;"><cite>Prologue to Amphitryon.</cite></span></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Under all these disadvantages, "King Arthur" was received
with great applause, at its first appearance; was often repeated,
and continues to be occasionally represented, being the only one
of Dryden's numerous plays which has retained possession of the
stage. Some part of its success was doubtless owing to the music,
of which Dr Burney gives the following account in his "History
of Music:"</p>

<p>"Of the music in "King Arthur," I shall say but little, as it
has been lately revived, well performed, and printed. If ever it
could, with truth, be said of a composer, that he had <i>devanc√© son
siecle</i>, Purcell is entitled to that praise; as there are movements
in many of his works which a century has not injured, particularly
the duet in "King Arthur," "Two Daughters of this Aged
Stream," and "Fairest Isle, all Isles excelling," which contain
not a single passage that the best composers of the present times,
if it presented itself to their imagination, would reject." vol. iii.
p. 492.</p>

<p>The dances, which were composed by the famous Priest, did
not disgrace the music and poetry; and the company, according
to Downes, were well rewarded for the time and expence they had
bestowed on "King Arthur."</p>

<p>This opera was acted and printed in 1691.</p>

<p><span class="drop-capi">T</span><span class="smcap">his</span> poem was the last
piece of service which I had the honour to do for my gracious master
King Charles II.; and, though he lived not to see the performance
of it on the stage, yet the Prologue to it, which was the opera of
"Albion and Albanius," was often practised before him at Whitehall, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
encouraged by his royal approbation. It was indeed a time which was
proper for triumph, when he had overcome all those difficulties which,
for some years, had perplexed his peaceful reign: but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
when he had just restored his people to their senses, and made the
latter end of his government of a piece with the happy beginning of it,
he was on the sudden snatched away from the blessings and acclamations
of his subjects, who arrived so late to the knowledge of him, that
they had but just time enough to desire him longer, before they were
to part with him for ever. Peace be with the ashes of so good a king!
Let his human frailties be forgotten, and his clemency and moderation
(the inherent virtues of his family) be remembered with a grateful
veneration by three kingdoms, through which he spread the blessings of
them. And, as your lordship held a principal place in his esteem, and,
perhaps, the first in his affection, during his latter troubles, the
success which accompanied those prudent counsels cannot but reflect
an honour on those few who managed them, and wrought out, by their
faithfulness and diligence, the public safety. I might dilate on the
difficulties which attended that undertaking, the temper of the people,
the power, arts and interest of the contrary party, but those are all
of them invidious topics,&mdash;they are too green in our remembrance,
and he, who touches on them, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Incedit per
ignes suppositos cineri doleso.</i> But, without reproaching one side
to praise another, I may justly recommend to both those wholesome
counsels, which, wisely administered, and as well executed, were the
means of preventing a civil war, and of extinguishing a growing fire
which was just ready to have broken forth among us. So many wives, who
have yet their husbands in their arms; so many parents, who have not
the number of their children lessened; so many villages, towns and
cities, whose inhabitants are not decreased, their property
violated, or their wealth diminished,&mdash;are yet
owing to the sober conduct, and happy results of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
your advice. If a true account may be expected by future ages from the
present, your lordship will be delivered over to posterity in a fairer
character than I have given; and be read, not in the preface of a play,
(whose author is not vain enough to promise immortality to others, or
to hope it for himself,) but in many pages of a chronicle, filled with
praises of your administration. For, if writers be just to the memory
of King Charles II., they cannot deny him to have been an exact knower
of mankind, and a perfect distinguisher of their talents. It is true,
his necessities often forced him to vary his counsellors and councils,
and sometimes to employ such persons in the management of his affairs,
who were rather fit for his present purpose than satisfactory to his
judgment: but where it was choice in him, not compulsion, he was master
of too much good sense to delight in heavy conversation; and whatever
his favourites of state might be, yet those of his affection were men of wit<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. He
was easy with these, and complied only with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
former. But in the latter part of his life, which certainly required
to be most cautiously managed, his secret thoughts were communicated
but to few, and those selected of that sort who were <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">amici omnium
horarum</i>, able to advise him in a serious consult, where his honour and
safety were concerned, and afterwards capable of entertaining him with
pleasant discourse, as well as profitable. In this maturest part of
his age, when he had been long seasoned with difficulties and dangers,
and was grown to a niceness in his choice, as being satisfied how few
could be trusted,&mdash;and, of those who could be trusted, how few
could serve him,&mdash;he confined himself to a small number of bosom
friends, amongst whom the world is much mistaken if your lordship was
not first.</p>

<p>If the rewards which you received for those services were only
honours, it rather shewed the necessities of the times, than any
want of kindness in your royal master; and, as the splendour of your
fortune stood not in need of being supported by the Crown, so likewise,
in being satisfied without other recompence, you showed yourself to
be above a mercenary interest, and strengthened that power which
bestowed those titles on you; which, truly speaking, were marks of
acknowledgement more than favour.</p>

<p>But, as a skilful pilot will not be tempted out to sea in suspected
weather, so have you wisely chosen to withdraw yourself from public
business, when the face of heaven grew troubled, and the frequent
shifting of the winds foreshewed a storm. There are times and seasons
when the best patriots are willing to withdraw their hands from the
commonwealth, as Phocion, in his latter days, was observed to decline
the management of affairs; or as Cicero,
(to draw the similitude more home) left the pulpit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
for Tusculum, and the praise of oratory for the sweet enjoyments of
a private life; and, in the happiness of those retirements, has more
obliged posterity by his moral precepts, than he did the republic
in quelling the conspiracy of Catiline. What prudent man would not
rather follow the example of his retreat, than stay, like Cato, with
a stubborn unseasonable virtue, to oppose the torrent of the people,
and at last be driven from the market-place by a riot of a multitude,
uncapable of counsel, and deaf to eloquence? There is likewise a
portion of our lives, which every wise man may justly reserve to his
own peculiar use, and that without defrauding his native country. A
Roman soldier was allowed to plead the merit of his services for his
dismission at such an age; and there was but one exception to that
rule, which was, an invasion from the Gauls. How far that may work
with your lordship, I am not certain, but I hope it is not coming
to the trial<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>In the mean time, while the nation is secured from foreign attempts
by so powerful a fleet, and we enjoy, not only the happiness, but even
the ornaments of peace, in the divertisement of the town, I humbly
offer you this trifle, which, if it succeed upon the stage, is like to
be the chiefest entertainment of our ladies and gentlemen this summer.
When I wrote it, seven years ago, I employed some reading about it, to
inform myself out of Beda, Bochartus and other authors, concerning the
rites and customs of the heathen Saxons; as I also used the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
little skill I have in poetry to adorn it<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. But, not
to offend the present times, nor a government which has hitherto
protected me, I have been obliged so much to alter the first design,
and take away so many beauties from the writing, that it is now no more
what it was formerly, than the present ship of the Royal Sovereign,
after so often taking down and altering, is the vessel it was at the
first building. There is nothing better than what I intended, but the
music; which has since arrived to a greater perfection in England
than ever formerly; especially passing through the artful hands of
Mr Purcell, who has composed it with so great a genius, that he has
nothing to fear but an ignorant, ill-judging audience. But the numbers
of poetry and vocal music are sometimes so contrary, that, in many
places, I have been obliged to cramp my verses, and make them rugged
to the reader, that they may be harmonious to the hearer; of which I
have no reason to repent me, because these sorts of entertainments are
principally designed for the ear and eye; and therefore, in reason, my
art, on this occasion, ought to be subservient to his. And, besides,
I flatter myself with an imagination, that a judicious audience will
easily distinguish betwixt the songs wherein I have complied with him,
and those in which I have followed the rules of poetry, in the sound
and cadence of the words. Notwithstanding all these disadvantages,
there is somewhat still remaining of the first spirit with which I wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
it; and though I can only speak by guess, of what pleased my first
and best patroness the Duchess of Monmouth in the reading, yet I will
venture my opinion, by the knowledge I have long had of her Grace's
excellent judgment and true taste of poetry, that the parts of the airy
and earthy spirits, and that fairy kind of writing which depends only
upon the force of imagination, were the grounds of her liking the poem,
and afterwards of her recommending it to the Queen. I have likewise
had the satisfaction to hear, that her majesty has graciously been
pleased to peruse the manuscript of this opera, and given it her royal
approbation. Poets, who subsist not but on the favour of sovereign
princes, and of great persons, may have leave to be a little vain, and
boast of their patronage, who encourage the genius that animates them;
and therefore, I will again presume to guess, that her majesty was not
displeased to find in this poem the praises of her native country, and
the heroic actions of so famous a predecessor in the government of
Great Britain as King Arthur.</p>

<p>All this, my lord, I must confess, looks with a kind of insinuation,
that I present you with somewhat not unworthy your protection; but
I may easily mistake the favour of her majesty for her judgment: I
think I cannot be deceived in thus addressing to your lordship, whom
I have had the honour to know, at that distance which becomes me, for
so many years. It is true, that formerly I have shadowed some part of
your virtues under another name; but the character, though short and
imperfect, was so true, that it broke through the fable,
and was discovered by its native light<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. What I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
pretend by this dedication, is an honour which I do myself to
posterity, by acquainting them, that I have been conversant with the
first persons of the age in which I lived; and thereby perpetuate my
prose, when my verses may possibly be forgotten, or obscured by the
fame of future poets. Which ambition, amongst my other faults and
imperfections, be pleased to pardon, in,</p>

<h2>CLEOMENES.</h2>


<p>There has been occasion to remark, that Dryden seldom avails
himself of national peculiarities, or national <i>costume</i>, in sketching
his dramatic personages; the present tragedy forms, however, a
remarkable exception to this general observation. Cleomenes, the
last of the Spartans, is designed, not only as a hero, but as a Lacedemonian;
and is a just picture of that extraordinary race of
men, whose virtues were comprized in patriotism, and whose whole
passions centered in a thirst for military glory. This character
Dryden has drawn with admirable spirit and precision. It was
indeed peculiarly suited to his genius; for, although sometimes deficient
in the pathos and natural expression of violent passion, by
which Otway, and even Southerne, could affect the passions of an
audience, he never fails in expressing, in the most noble language,
the sentiments of that stoical philosophy, which considers sufferings
rather as subjects of moral reflection, than of natural feeling. Yet,
lest a character so invulnerable to the shafts of adversity, so much
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">totus teres atque rotundus</i> of the poet, should fail to interest
the audience, (for we seldom pity those who shew no symptoms of
feeling their own sorrows,) Dryden has softened the character of
his Spartan hero by the influence of those chaste and tender domestic
affections, which thrive best in bosoms rendered by nature
or philosophy inaccessible to selfish feeling. The haughty and unbending
spirit, the love of war, and thirst of honour proper to the
Lacedemonian, and inculcated by the whole train of his education,
complete the character of Cleomenes. The same spirit, which
animates the father, is finely represented as descending upon the
son. Cleonidas is a model of a Spartan youth; and every slight
expression which he uses, tends to bring out that celebrated character.
The idea of this spirited boy seems to be taken from the
excellent character of Hengo, in the "Bonduca" of Beaumont and
Fletcher; whom Cleonidas resembles in the manner of his death,
and in his previous sufferings by hunger, as well as in his premature
courage, and emulation of his father's military glory.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
wife and mother of Cleomenes seem to be sketched after those of
Coriolanus: the former exhibiting a mild and gentle disposition;
the latter, the high-souled magnanimity of a Spartan matron. Of
the other characters, little need be said. Ptolemy is a silly tyrant,
Sosibius a wily minister, and Cleanthes a friend and confident;
such as tyrants, ministers, and confidents in tragedies usually
are. Judging from his first appearance, the author seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
have intended Pantheus as a character somewhat in contrast to
that of Cleomenes; but he soon tires of the task of discrimination,
and Pantheus sinks into a mere assistant. Cassandra is not
sketched with any peculiar care; her snares are of a nature not
very perilous to Spartan virtue, for her manners are too openly
licentious. Such, however, as are fond of tracing the ideas of
poets to those who have written before them, may consider Cassandra,&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
her pride, her love, and her alternate schemes for saving
and destroying Cleomenes,&mdash;as furnishing the original hint of
the much more highly finished character of Zara in Congreve's
"Mourning Bride."</p>

<p>The conduct of the piece, being calculated to evince the Spartan
virtue, patience, and courage, contains a long train of hopes
disappointed, seducing temptations resisted, sufferings patiently
endured, and finally closed by a voluntary death. There is no
particular object to which the attention of the audience is fixed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
as that upon which the conclusion of the piece necessarily depends.
The liberation of Cleomenes from his Egyptian bondage
is doubtless the consummation concerning which the poet meant
that we should be anxious; but this event might be brought
about in so many different ways, and, if accomplished, brings
Cleomenes so little nearer to the restoration of Spartan liberty,
that it is perhaps insufficient to excite that strong, concentrated,
and vivid interest, which the plot of a drama ought properly to inspire.
The mind is distracted among the various possibilities by
which the desired catastrophe might be accomplished; and feels a
consciousness, that even were Cleomenes dismissed with full sails
from the port of Alexandria, it would be rather the beginning
than the winding up of his history. For these reasons, the plot
seems more deficient in interest than might have been expected,
from the spirited delineation of the principal character.</p>

<p>It appears that Dryden was unable, from illness, to put the
finishing strokes to "Cleomenes." That task he committed to
Southerne, now his intimate friend, and who, as may be easily
imagined, felt himself much honoured by the task imposed upon
him.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The half of the fifth act was that upon which Southerne
exercised this power of revisal and finishing; for that it amounted
to no more, will, I think, be obvious to any who takes the trouble
to compare that act with those which precede it. The rabble-scene,
introduced, as the poet himself tells us, to gratify the more
barbarous part of his audience, is indeed deplorably bad.</p>

<p>The play, when presented to the theatre, met with unexpected
opposition from the government, then directed by Queen Mary, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the absence of her husband. This was not very surprising, considering
the subject of the play, and Dryden's well-known principles.
The history of an exiled monarch, soliciting, in the court
of an ally, aid to relieve his country from a foreign yoke, and to
restore him to the throne of his fathers, with the account of a popular
insurrection undertaken for the same purposes, were delicate
themes during the reign of William III.; at least, when the
pen of Dryden was to be employed in them, whose well-known
skill at adapting an ancient story to a modern moral had so often
been exercised in the cause of the house of Stuart. Besides, he
had already given offence by his prologue to the "Prophetess,"
when revived, which contains some familiar metaphorical sneers,
as Cibber calls them, at the Irish war, the female regency, and
even the Revolution itself. This prologue had been forbidden;
and a similar exertion of authority was deemed fit in the case of
"Cleomenes." Accordingly, before the inoffensive nature of the
piece could be explained, the court took alarm at the subject in
the abstract, and the performance of the piece was prohibited by
the Chamberlain.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It appears, the exertions of Lord Rochester,
the maternal uncle of Queen Mary, and of his family, had been
sufficiently powerful to guarantee the harmless nature of the play,
and to procure a recal of the mandate, by which the acting of the
piece, and the consequent profits of the author, had been for some
time suspended.</p>

<p>When the play was performed, our author had the satisfaction
to see the first character admirably represented by the well-known
Mrs Barry, to whom he has paid, in the preface, the splendid compliment
of saying, "that she had gained by her performance a
reputation beyond any woman he had ever seen on the theatre."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
If this expression, as Cibber seems to think, be a little over-stretched,
it at least serves to prove to us, that the play was well received;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
for, otherwise, the intercourse of civility between the author
and performers is generally very slender.</p>

<p><span class="drop-capi">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is enough for your
lordship to be conscious to yourself of having performed a just and
honourable action, in redeeming this play from the persecution of my
enemies; but it would be ingratitude in me, not to publish it to the
world. That it has appeared on the stage, is principally owing to you:
that it has succeeded, is the approbation of your judgment by that of
the public. It is just the inversion of an act of parliament: Your
lordship first signed it, and then it was passed amongst the Lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and Commons. The children of old men are generally observed to be
short-lived, and of a weakly constitution. How this may prove, I know
not, but hitherto it has promised well; and if it survive to posterity,
it will carry the noble fame of its patron along with it; or, rather,
it will be carried by yours to after-ages. Ariosto, in his Voyage of
Astolpho to the Moon, has given us a fine allegory of two swans; who,
when Time had thrown the writings of many poets into the river of
oblivion, were ever in a readiness to secure the best, and bear
them aloft into the temple of immortality.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Whether
this poem be of that number, is left to the judgment of the swan who
has preserved it; and, though I can claim little from his justice, I
may presume to value myself upon his charity. It will be told me, that
I have mistaken the Italian poet, who means only, that some excellent
writers, almost as few in number as the swans, have rescued the memory
of their patrons from forgetfulness and time; when a vast multitude of
crows and vultures, that is, bad scribblers, parasites, and flatterers,
oppressed by the weight of the names which they endeavoured to redeem,
were forced to let them fall into Lethe, where they were lost for ever.
If it be thus, my lord, the table would be turned upon me; but I should
only fail in my vain attempt; for, either some immortal swan will be
more capable of sustaining such a weight, or you, who have so long been
conversant in the management of great affairs, are able with your pen
to do justice to yourself, and, at the same time, to give the nation a
clearer and more faithful insight into those transactions, wherein
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>you have worthily sustained so great a part; for,
to your experience in state affairs, you have also joined no vulgar
erudition, which all your modesty is not able to conceal: for, to
understand critically the delicacies of Horace, is a height to which
few of our noblemen have arrived; and that this is your deserved
commendation, I am a living evidence, as far, at least, as I can be
allowed a competent judge on that subject. Your affection to that
admirable Ode, which Horace writes to his Mec√¶nas, and which I had the
honour to inscribe to you, is not the only proof of this assertion<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. You may please
to remember that, in the late happy conversation which I had with your
lordship at a noble relation's of yours, you took me aside, and pleased
yourself with repeating to me one of the most beautiful pieces in that
author. It was the Ode to Barine, wherein you were so particularly
affected with that elegant expression, <i>Juvenumque prodis publica
cura</i>. There is indeed the virtue of a whole poem in those words; that
<i>curiosa felicitas</i>, which Petronius so justly ascribes to our author.
The barbarity of our language is not able to reach it; yet, when I have
leisure, I mean to try how near I can raise my English to his Latin;
though, in the mean time, I cannot but imagine to myself, with what
scorn his sacred <i>manes</i> would look on so lame a translation as I could
make. His <i>recalcitrat undique tutus</i> might more easily be applied to
me, than he himself applied it to Augustus C√¶sar. I ought to reckon
that day as very fortunate to me, and distinguish it, as the ancients
did, with a whiter stone; because it furnished me with an occasion of
reading my Cleomenes to a beautiful assembly of ladies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
where your lordship's three fair daughters were
pleased to grace it with their presence<a name="FNanchor_33_33"
id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33"
class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; and, if I may have leave to single out
any one in particular, there was your admirable daughter-in-law,
shining, not like a star, but a constellation of herself, a more true
and brighter Berenice. Then it was, that, whether out of your own
partiality, and indulgence to my writings, or out of complaisance to
the fair company, who gave the first good omen to my success by their
approbation, your lordship was pleased to add your own, and afterwards
to represent it to the queen, as wholly innocent of those crimes which
were laid unjustly to its charge. Neither am I to forget my charming
patroness, though she will not allow my public address to her in a
dedication, but protects me unseen, like my guardian-angel, and shuns
my gratitude, like a fairy, who is bountiful by stealth, and conceals
the giver when she bestows the gift; but, my Lady Silvius<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
has been juster to me, and pointed out the goddess at whose altar I
was to pay my sacrifice and thanks-offering; and, had she been silent,
yet my Lord Chamberlain himself, in restoring my play without any
alteration, avowed to me, that I had the most earnest solicitress, as
well as the fairest, and that nothing could be refused to my Lady Hyde.</p>

<p>These favours, my lord, received from yourself,
and your noble family, have encouraged me to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
dedication; wherein I not only give you back a play, which, had you not
redeemed it, had not been mine; but also, at the same time, dedicate
to you the unworthy author, with my inviolable faith, and (how mean
soever) my utmost service; and I shall be proud to hold my dependance
on you in chief, as I do part of my small fortune in Wiltshire. Your
goodness has not been wanting to me during the reign of my two masters;
and, even from a bare treasury, my success has been contrary to that of
Mr Cowley; and Gideon's fleece has then been moistened,
when all the ground has been dry about it<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. Such
and so many provocations of this nature have concurred to my invading
of your modesty with this address. I am sensible that it is in a manner
forced upon you; but your lordship has been the aggressor in this
quarrel, by so many favours, which you were not weary of conferring on
me, though, at the same time, I own the ambition on my side, to be ever
esteemed,</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="drop-capi">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is now seven or eight years since I designed to
write this play of "Cleomenes;" and my Lord Falkland<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>,
(whose name I cannot mention without honour, for the many favours I have
received from him) is pleased to witness for me, that, in a French book
which I presented him about that time, there were the names of many
subjects that I had thought on for the stage, amongst which this tragedy
was one. This was out of my remembrance; but my lord, on the occasion
of stopping my play, took the opportunity of doing me a good office at
court, by representing it as it was, a piece long ago designed; which
being judiciously treated, I thought was capable of moving compassion on
the stage. The success has justified my opinion; and that at a time
when the world is running mad after Farce, the extremity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of bad poetry, or rather the judgment that is fallen upon dramatic
writing. Were I in the humour, I have sufficient cause to expose it
in its true colours; but, having for once escaped, I will forbear my
satire, and only be thankful for my deliverance. A great part of my
good fortune, I must confess, is owing to the justice which was done
me in the performance. I can scarcely refrain from giving every one of
the actors their particular commendations; but none of them will be
offended, if I say what the town has generally granted, that Mrs Barry,
always excellent, has, in this tragedy, excelled herself, and gained a
reputation beyond any woman whom I have ever seen on the theatre. After
all, it was a bold attempt of mine, to write upon a single plot, unmixed
with comedy; which, though it be the natural and true way, yet is not
to the genius of the nation. Yet, to gratify the barbarous party of my
audience, I gave them a short rabble-scene, because the mob (as they call
them) are represented by Plutarch and Polybius, with the same character
of baseness and cowardice, which are here described in the last attempt
of "Cleomenes." They may thank me, if they please, for this indulgence;
for no French poet would have allowed them any more than a bare relation
of that scene, which debases a tragedy to show upon the stage. </p>

<p>For the rest, some of the mechanic rules of unity are observed, and
others are neglected. The action is but one, which is the death of
Cleomenes; and every scene in the play is tending to the accomplishment
of the main design. The place is likewise one; for, it is all in the
compass of Alexandria, and the port of that city. The time might easily
have been reduced into the space of twenty-four
hours, if I would have omitted the scene of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
famine in the fifth act; but it pleased me to try how Spartans could
endure it; and, besides, gave me the occasion of writing that other
scene, betwixt Cleomenes and his suspected friend; and, in such a case,
it is better to trespass on a rule, than leave out a beauty. </p>

<p>As for other objections, I never heard any worth answering; and,
least of all, that foolish one which is raised against me by the sparks,
for Cleomenes not accepting the favours of Cassandra. They would not have
refused a fair lady! I grant they would not; but, let them grant me, that
they are not heroes; and so much for the point of honour<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. A
man might have pleaded an excuse for himself, if he had been false to an
old wife, for the sake of a young mistress; but Cleora was in the flower
of her age, and it was yet but honey-moon with Cleomenes; and so much for
nature. Some have told me, that many of the fair sex complain for want
of tender scenes, and soft expressions of love. I will endeavour to make
them some amends, if I write again, and my next hero shall be no Spartan.</p>

<p>I know it will be here expected, that I should write somewhat
concerning the forbidding of my play; but, the less I say of it, the
better. And, besides, I was so little concerned at it, that, had it not

should not have been at all solicitous whether it were played or no. Nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
can imagine that, in my declining age, I write willingly, or that I am
desirous of exposing, at this time of day, the small reputation which I
have gotten on the theatre. The subsistence which I had from the former
government is lost; and the reward I have from the stage is so little,
that it is not worth my labour. </p>

<p>As for the reasons which were given for suspending the play, it seems
they were so ill-founded, that my Lord Chamberlain no sooner took the
pains to read it, but they vanished; and my copy was restored to me,
without the least alteration by his lordship. It is printed as it was
acted; and, I dare assure you, that here is no parallel to be found:
it is neither compliment, nor satire; but a plain story, more strictly
followed than any which has appeared upon the stage. It is true, it had
been garbled before by the superiors of the play-house; and I cannot
reasonably blame them for their caution, because they are answerable for
any thing that is publicly represented; and their zeal for the government
is such, that they had rather lose the best poetry in the world, than
give the least suspicion of their loyalty. The short is, that they were
diligent enough to make sure work, and to geld it so clearly in some
places, that they took away the very manhood of it. I can only apply to
them, what Cassandra says somewhere in the play to Ptolemy; </p>

<p>But, since it concerns me to be as circumspect as

faithfully translated out of Plutarch, by my learned

<p>But, to return to Plutarch: you will find him particularly fond of
Cleomenes his character; who, as he was the last of the Spartan heroes,
so he was, in my opinion, the greatest. Even his enemy, Polybius, though
engaged in the contrary faction, yet speaks honourably of him, and
especially of his last action in Egypt. This author is also made English,
and will shortly be published for the common benefit<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p>What I have added to the story, is chiefly the love of Agathoclea,
the king's mistress, whose name I have changed into Cassandra, only for
the better sound; as I have also the name of Nicagoras, into that of
C&oelig;nus, for the same reason. Cratesicl√¶a, Pantheus, and Sosybius,
are to be found in the story, with the same characters which they have in
the tragedy. There is likewise mention made of the son of Cleomenes, who
had resolution enough to throw himself headlong from a tower, when he had
heard of his father's ill success. And for Cleora, whom I make the second
wife of Cleomenes, (for √Ügiatis was dead before) you will find a hint of
her in Plutarch; for, he tells us, that after the loss of the battle at
Sellasia, he returned to Sparta, and, entering his own house, was there
attended by a free-born woman of Megalopolis. </p>

<p>The picture of Ptolemy Philopater is given by the fore-mentioned
authors to the full. Both agree that he was an original of his kind; a
lazy, effeminate, cowardly, cruel, and luxurious prince, managed by his
favourite, and imposed on by his mistress.
The son of Sosybius, whom I call Cleanthes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
was a friend to Cleomenes; but, Plutarch says, he at length forsook
him. I have given him a fairer character, and made it only a seeming
treachery, which he practised. If any be so curious to enquire what
became of Cassandra, whose fortune was left in suspence at the
conclusion of the play, I must first inform them, that, after the death
of Cleomenes, (the hero of my poem) I was obliged by the laws of the
drama, to let fall the curtain immediately, because the action was then
concluded. But Polybius tells us, that she survived Ptolemy, who reigned
about twenty-seven years; that, with her brother Agathocles, she governed
Egypt in the minority of his son Ptolemy Epiphanes; and that, finally,
for oppressing of the people, both the brother and sister were slain in a
popular insurrection. </p>

<p>There is nothing remaining, but my thanks to the town in general,
and to the fair ladies in particular, for their kind reception of my
play. And, though I cannot retract what I said before, that I was not
much concerned, in my own particular, for the embargo which was laid
upon it, yet I think myself obliged, at the same time, to render my
acknowledgments to those honourable persons, who were instrumental in
the freeing it; for, as it was from a principle of nobleness in them,
that they would not suffer one to want, who was grown old in their
service, so, it is from a principle of another sort, that I have learned
to possess my soul in patience, and not to be much disquieted with any
disappointment of this nature. </p>

<h2><span class="smaller">THE</span><br />
<br />
LIFE OF CLEOMENES,</h2>

<p class="p1">TRANSLATED FROM PLUTARCH</p>

<p class="p2">BY</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Mr</span> THOMAS CREECH.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="drop-capi">T</span><span class="smcap">hus</span> fell Agis. His brother Archidamus was too quick for Leonidas,
and saved himself by a timely retreat. But his wife then newly brought
to bed, the tyrant forced her from her own house, and compelled her to
marry his son Cleomenes, though at that time too young for a wife; for
he was unwilling that any one else should have her, she being heiress to
her father Gylippus's great estate; for person, the finest woman in all
Greece, very good-natured, of an exemplary life; and therefore, they say,
she did all she could, that she might not be compelled to this match.</p>

<p>Being thus married to Cleomenes, she hated Leonidas; but to the youth
she showed herself a kind and obliging wife. He, as soon as they came
together, began to love her very much; and the constant kindness that she
still retained for the memory of Agis, wrought somewhat of concern in the
young man for him; so that he would often enquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of her concerning what had passed, and attentively listen to the story
of Agis's designs. Now Cleomenes had a generous and great soul: he was
as temperate and moderate in his pleasures as Agis, but not so very
cautious, circumspect, and gentle; a spur of passion always galled him,
and his eagerness to pursue that which he thought good and just, was
violent and heady. To make men willing to obey, he conceived to be the
best discipline; but likewise to break the stubborn, and force them to
be better, was, in his opinion, commendable and brave. This disposition
made him dislike the management of the city. The citizens lay dissolved
in supine idleness and pleasures; the king minded nothing, designing, if
nobody gave him any disturbance, to waste his time in ease and riot; the
public was neglected, and each man intent upon his private gain. It was
dangerous, now Agis was killed, to mention the exercising and training
of their youth; and to set up for the ancient bravery and equality, was
treason against the state. It is said also, that Cleomenes, whilst a boy,
studied philosophy under Sph√¶rus the Borysthenite, who, coming to Sparta,
was very diligent in instructing the youth. Sph√¶rus was one of the
chief of Zeno the Citiean's scholars; and it is likely that he admired
the manly temper of Cleomenes, and inflamed his generous ambition. The
ancient Leonidas, as story saith, being asked, What manner of poet he
thought Tyrt√¶us? replied, An excellent one to whet the courages of youth;
for, being filled with fury by his poems, they daringly ventured on any
danger. Now the Stoic philosophy is a dangerous incentive to hot and
fiery dispositions; but being mixed with a grave and cautious temper, is
very good to fix and settle the resolutions. </p>

<p>Upon the death of his father Leonidas, he succeeded;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and, observing the citizens of all sorts to be debauched, the rich
neglecting the public, and intent on their own gain and pleasure, and the
poor being cramped in their private fortunes, grown inactive, cowards,
and not inclinable to the Spartan institution and way of breeding, that
he had only the name of King, and the Ephori all the power, was resolved
to change the present posture of affairs. He had a friend, whose name
was Xenares, his lover, (such an affection the Spartans express by the
word [Greek: empneithai],) him he sounded; and of him he would commonly
enquire, What manner of king Agis was, by what means, and by what
assistance he began and pursued his designs. Xenares at first willingly
complied with his request, and told him the whole story, with all the
particular circumstances of the actions. But when he observed Cleomenes
to be extremely affected at the relation, and more than ordinarily moved
at Agis's new model of the government, and begging a repetition of the
story, he at first severely chid him, told him he was frantic, and at
last left off all sort of familiarity and conversation with him; yet
he never told any man the cause of their disagreement, but would only
say, "Cleomenes knew very well." Cleomenes finding Xenares averse to his
designs, and thinking all others to be of the same opinion, consulted
with none, but contrived the whole business by himself. And considering
that it would be easier to bring about an alteration when the city was at
war than when in peace, he engaged the commonwealth in a quarrel with the
Ach√¶ans, who had given them fair occasions to complain; for Aratus, a man
of the greatest power amongst all the Ach√¶ans, designed, from the very
beginning, to bring all the Peloponnesians into one common body. And to
effect this, he undertook many expeditions, and ran through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
long course of policy; for he thought this the only means to make
them an equal match for their foreign enemies. All the rest agreed to
his proposals; only the Laced√¶monians, the Eleans, and as many of the
Arcadians as inclined to the Spartan interest, refused. Therefore, as
soon as Leonidas was dead, he fell upon the Arcadians, and wasted those
especially that bordered on Achaia; by this means designing to try the
inclinations of the Spartans, and despising Cleomenes as a youth, and
of no experience in affairs of state or war. Upon this the Ephori sent
Cleomenes to surprise the Athen√¶um, dedicated to Minerva, near Belbina,
which is a pass of Laconia, and was then under the jurisdiction of the
Megalopolitans. Cleomenes possessed himself of the place, and fortified
it; at which action Aratus shewed no public resentment, but marched by
night to surprise Tegea and Orchomenium. The design failed; for those
that were to betray the cities into his hands, doubted the success; so
Aratus retreated, imagining that his design had been undiscovered. But
Cleomenes wrote a jeering letter to him, and desired to know, as from
a friend, whither he intended to march at night? And Aratus answering,
That having understood his design to fortify Belbina, he resolved to
march thither to oppose him; Cleomenes returned, That he believed it, but
desired him to give an account, if it stood with his convenience, why he
carried those torches and ladders with him. </p>

<p>Aratus laughing at the jeer, and asking what manner of youth this
was? Democrites, a Spartan exile, replied, "If you have any designs upon
the Laced√¶monians, begin before this young eagle's talons are grown."
Presently after this, Cleomenes being in Arcadia with a few horse, and
300 foot, the Ephori, fearing to engage in the war, commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
him home; but upon his retreat, Aratus taking Caphu√¶, they commissioned
him again. In this expedition he took Methudrium, and spoiled the country
of the Argives; and the Ach√¶ans, to stop his victory, and secure their
friends, sent 20,000 foot and 1000 horse against him, under the command
of Aristomachus. Cleomenes faced them at Palantium, and offered battle;
but Aratus being dashed at his bravery, would not suffer the general
to engage, but retreated; being cursed by the Ach√¶ans, and hooted at,
and scorned by the Spartans, who were not above 5000, for a coward.
Cleomenes, encouraged by this success, began to vaunt among the citizens,
a sentence of one of their ancient kings, who said, "The Spartans seldom
enquired how many their enemies were, but where they were." After this,
marching to the assistance of the Eleans, upon whom the Ach√¶ans warred,
and about Lyc√¶um falling upon the enemy in their retreat, he routed their
whole army, taking a great number of captives, and leaving many dead upon
the place; so that it was commonly reported amongst the Greeks, that
Aratus was slain. But Aratus making the best advantage of the opportunity
presently after the defeat, marched to Mantin√¶a and, before any body
suspected it, took the city, and put a new garrison into it. Upon this
the Laced√¶monians being quite discouraged, and opposing Cleomenes's
design of carrying on the war, he was eager to send for Archidamus,
Agis's brother, from Messena; for he of the other family had a right to
the kingdom: and, beside, Cleomenes thought, that the power of the Ephori
would be abated, when the kingly state was filled up, and equally poised
between the two families. But those that were concerned in the murder
of Agis, understanding the design, and fearing that upon Archidamus's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
return they should be called to an account, received him coming privately
into town, waited on him, and presently after murdered him; but whether
Cleomenes was against it, as Phylarchus imagines or whether he was
persuaded by his friends, and winked at the contrivance, is uncertain;
however, they were most blamed, as having forced his consent. But he
still resolving to new-model the state, bribed the Ephori to make him
general; and won the affections of many others by means of his mother
Cratesiclea, who spared no cost, and was very zealous to promote the
same interest; and though of herself she had no inclination to marry,
yet for her son's sake she wedded one of the chiefest citizens for
wealth and power. Cleomenes marching forth with the army now under
his command, took Leuctra, a place belonging to Megalopolis; and the
Ach√¶ans quickly facing him with a good body of men commanded by Aratus,
in a battle under the very walls of the city, some part of his army was
routed; but Aratus commanding the Ach√¶ans not to pass a deep hollow, and
stopping the pursuit, Lydiadas the Megalopolitan, fretting at the orders,
encouraging the horse which he led, and pursuing the routed enemy, fell
into a place full of vines, hedges, and ditches; and being forced to
break his ranks, was put into a great disorder. Cleomenes observing the
advantage, commanded the Tarentines and Cretans to engage him, by whom,
after a brave dispute, he was routed and slain. The Laced√¶monians, thus
encouraged, with a great shout fell upon the Ach√¶ans, and routed their
whole army. Of the slain, which were very many, some Cleomenes delivered
upon articles; but the body of Lydiadas he commanded to be brought to
him; and then putting on it a purple robe, and a crown
upon its head, sent a convoy with it to the gates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Megalopolis. This Lydiadas was the man that resigned his crown, restored
liberty to the citizens, and joined the city to the Ach√¶an interest.
Cleomenes being very much raised by this success, and persuaded, that
if matters were wholly at his disposal, he should quickly be too hard
for the Ach√¶ans; he taught Megistones, his mother's husband, that it was
expedient for the state to shake off the power of the Ephori, and to put
all their wealth into one common stock for the whole body; that Sparta,
being restored to its old equality, might be raised up to be mistress of
all Greece. Megistones liked the design, and engaged two or three more of
his friends. About that time one of the Ephori, sleeping in Pasiphae's
temple, dreamed a very surprising dream; for he thought he saw the four
chairs removed out of the place where the Ephori used to sit and hear
causes, and one only set there; and whilst he wondered, he heard a voice
out of the temple, saying, "This is best for Sparta." The person telling
Cleomenes this dream, he was a little troubled at first, fearing that he
used this as a trick to sift him, upon some suspicion of his design; but
when he was satisfied that the relater spoke truth, he took heart again;
and taking with him those whom he thought would be against his model, he
took Er√¶a and Alc√¶a, two cities of the Ach√¶ans, furnished Orchomenium
with provisions, besieged Mantin√¶a, and with long marches so harassed
the Laced√¶monians, that many of them desired to be left in Arcadia; and
he satisfied their request. With the mercenaries he marched to Sparta;
and by the way communicated his design to those, whom he thought fittest
for his purpose, and marched slowly, that he might catch the Ephori at
supper. When he was come near the city, he sent Eurycleidas to
the Sussitium, the eating place of the Ephori, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
pretence of carrying some message from him from the army; Threicion,
Ph√¶bis, and two of those who were bred with Cleomenes, whom they call
Samothrac√¶ followed with a few soldiers; and whilst Eurycleidas was
delivering his message to the Ephori, they ran upon them with their drawn
swords, and slew them. Agesilaus, as soon as he was run through, fell,
and lay as dead; but in a little time he rose, silently conveyed himself
out of the room, and crept undiscovered into a little house, which was
the temple of Fear, and which always used to be shut, but was then by
chance open; being got in, he shut the door, and lay close: the other
four were killed, and above ten more that came to their assistance. To
those that were quiet, they did no harm, stopt none that fled the city,
and spared Agesilaus, who came out of the temple the next day. The
Laced√¶monians have not only temples dedicated to Fear, but also to Death,
Laughter, and the like passions. Now they worship Fear, not as they do
those deities which they dread, esteeming it hurtful, but thinking their
policy is chiefly kept up by law; and therefore the Ephori, (Aristotle
is my author,) when they enter upon their government, make proclamation
to the people, that they should shave their whiskers, and be obedient to
the laws, that they might not be forced to be severe; using this trivial
particular, in my opinion, to accustom their youth to obedience, even
in the smallest matters. And the ancients, I think, did not imagine
fortitude to be plain fearlessness, but a cautious fear of infamy and
disgrace: for those that shew most fear towards the laws, are most bold
against their enemies; and those are least afraid of any danger, who are
most afraid of a just reproach. Therefore he said well, </p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;">A reverence still attends on fear.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>And Homer,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Feared you shall be, dear uncle, and revered.</span></p>

<p>And again,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;">In silence fearing those that bore the sway.</span></p>

<p>For it is very commonly seen, that men reverence those whom they
fear; and therefore the Laced√¶monians placed the temple of Fear by the
Sussitium of the Ephori, having raised their power to almost absolute
monarchy.</p>

<p>The next day Cleomenes proscribed eighty of the citizens, whom he
thought necessary to banish, and removed all the seats of the Ephori,
except one, in which he himself designed to sit, and hear causes; and
calling the citizens together, he made an apology for his proceedings;
saying, "That by Lycurgus the senate was joined to the kings, and that
that model of government had continued a long time, and needed no other
sort of magistrates to give it perfection. But afterward, in the long war
with the Messenians, when the kings, being to command the army, had no
time to attend civil causes, they chose some of their friends, and left
them to determine the suits of the citizens in their stead. These were
called Ephori, and at first behaved themselves as servants to the kings;
but afterward, by degrees, they appropriated the power to themselves,
and erected a distinct sort of magistracy. An evidence of the truth of
this may be taken from the usual behaviour of the kings, who, upon the
first and second message of the Ephori, refuse to go; but upon the third,
readily attend them: and Asteropus, the first that raised the Ephori to
that height of power, lived a great many years after their institution;
therefore, whilst they modestly contained themselves within their own
proper sphere, it was better to bear with them than to make a disturbance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
But that an upstart introduced power should so far destroy the old
model of government, as to banish some kings, murder others without
hearing their defence, and threaten those who desired to see the best
and most divine constitution restored in Sparta, was insufferable;
therefore if it had been possible for him, without bloodshed, to have
freed Laced√¶mon from those foreign plagues, luxury, vanity, debts, and
usury, and from those more ancient evils, poverty and riches, he should
have thought himself the happiest king in the world; having, like an
expert physician, cured the diseases of his country without pain. But
now, in this necessity, Lycurgus's example favoured his proceedings,
who, being neither king nor magistrate, but a private man, and aiming
at the kingdom, came armed into the market-place, and, for fear of the
king Carileus, fled to the altar; but he being a good man, and a lover
of his country, readily consented to Lycurgus's project, and admitted
an alteration in the state. Thus, by his own actions, Lycurgus showed,
that it was difficult to correct the government without force and fear;
in using which, he said, he would be so moderate, as never to desire
their assistance, but either to terrify or ruin the enemies of Sparta's
happiness and safety." He commanded, that all the land should be left in
common, and private claims laid aside; that debtors should be discharged
of their debts, and a strict search made, who were foreigners, and who
not; that the true Spartans, recovering their courage, might defend the
city by their arms; and that we may no longer see Laconia, for want of
a sufficient number to secure it, wasted by the √Ütolians and Illyrians.
Then he himself first, with his father-in-law Megistones, and his friends,
brought all their wealth into one public stock, and all the other citizens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
followed the example. The land was divided, and every one that he had
banished had a share assigned him; for he promised to restore all,
as soon as things were settled, and in quiet: and compleating the
common number of citizens, out of the best and most agreeable of the
neighbouring inhabitants, he raised a body of four thousand men; and,
instead of a spear, taught them to use a sarissa (a long pike) with both
hands, and to carry their shields by a string fastened round their arms,
and not by a handle, as before. After this he began to consult about
the exercising and breeding of the youth, many particulars of which,
Sph√¶rus, being then at Sparta, directed; and in a short time the schools
of exercise, and their <i>Sussitia</i>, (common eating places,) recovered
their ancient decency and order; a few out of necessity, but the most
voluntarily applying themselves to that generous and Laconic way of
living. Besides, that the name of monarch might give them no jealousy, he
made Eucleidas, his brother, partner in the throne; and that was the only
time that Sparta had two kings of the same family. Then understanding
that the Ach√¶ans and Aratus imagined that this change had disturbed and
shaken his affairs, and that he would not venture out of Sparta, and
leave the city, now unsettled by so great an alteration, he thought it
great and serviceable to his designs, to convince his enemies that he
was eagerly desirous of a war; and therefore making an incursion into
the territories of Megalopolis, he wasted the country very much, and got
a considerable booty. And at last taking those that used to act in the
public solemnities travelling from Messena, and building a theatre in the
enemy's country, and setting a prize of L. 40 value, he sat spectator a
whole day; not that he either desired or needed such a divertisement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
but as it were insulting over his enemies; and that by thus manifestly
despising them, he might show, that he had more than conquered the
Ach√¶ans. For that alone, of all the Greek or kings' armies, had no
stage-players, no jugglers, no dancing or singing women attending it,
but was free from all sorts of looseness, wantonness, and foppery; the
young men being for the most part upon duty, and the old men teaching
them at leisure time to apply themselves to their usual drollery, and to
rally one another facetiously after the Laconic fashion; the advantages
of which I have discovered in the life of Lycurgus. He himself instructed
all by his example: he was a living pattern of temperance before every
body's eyes, and his course of living was neither more stately nor
more expensive than any of the commons. And this was a considerable
advantage to him in his designs on Greece; for men, when they waited
upon other kings, did not so much admire their wealth, costly furniture,
and numerous attendance, as they hated their pride and state, their
difficulty of access, and scornful commanding answers to their petitions.
But when they came to Cleomenes, who was both really a king, and bore
that title, and saw no purple, no robes of state upon him, no chairs and
couches about him for his ease, and that he did not receive petitions,
and return answers, after a long delay, by a number of messengers,
waiters, or by bills, but that he rose and came forward to meet those
that came to wait upon him, stayed, talked freely and graciously with
all that had business; they were extremely taken, won to his service,
and professed that he alone was the true son of Hercules. His common
every-day's meal was in a mean room, very sparing, and after the Laconic
manner; and when he entertained ambassadors,
or strangers, two more beds were added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and a little better dinner provided by his servants; but no fricasees,
no dainties, only the dishes were larger, and the wine more plentiful;
for he reproved one of his friends for entertaining some strangers with
nothing but pulse and black broth, such diet as they usually had in
their Phiditia; saying, that upon such occasions, and when they treat
strangers, it was not requisite to be too exact Laconians. After supper,
a stand was brought in with a brass vessel full of wine, two silver
pots, which held almost a quart a piece, a few silver cups, of which he
that pleased might drink, but no liquor was forced on any of the guests.
There was no music, nor was any required; for he entertained the company,
sometimes asking questions, sometimes telling stories: and his discourse
was neither too grave, and unpleasantly serious, nor vain and abusive,
but merrily facetious; for he thought those ways of catching men by gifts
and presents, which other kings use, to be mean and inartificial; and
it seemed to him to be the most glorious method, and most suitable to
a king, to win the affections of those that came near him, by pleasant
discourse, and unaffected conversation; for a friend and mercenary differ
only in this, that the one is made by conversation and agreeableness
of humour, and the other by reward. The Mantin√¶ans were the first that
obliged him; for, getting by night into the city, and driving out the
Ach√¶an garrison, they put themselves under his protection; he restored
them their polity and laws, and the same day marched to Tegea; and a
little while after, fetching a compass through Arcadia, he made a descent
upon Pher√¶, in Achaia, intending to force Aratus to a battle, or bring
him into disrepute, for refusing to engage, and suffering him to waste the
country. Hyperbatus at that time commanded the army, but Aratus had all the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
amongst the Ach√¶ans. The Ach√¶ans marching forth with their whole
strength, and encamping in Dume√¶, about Hecatomb√¶um, Cleomenes came up,
and thinking it not advisable to pitch between Dume√¶, a city of the
enemy's, and the camp of the Ach√¶ans, he boldly dared the Ach√¶ans, and
forced them to a battle; and routing the phalanx, slew a great many in
the fight, and took many prisoners; thence marching to Lagon, and driving
out the Ach√¶an garrison, he restored the city to the El√¶ans. The affairs
of the Ach√¶ans being in this desperate condition, Aratus, who was wont
to continue in his government above a year, refused the command, though
they entreated and urged him to accept it; and this was ill done, when
the storm was high, to put the power out of his own hands, and set
another to the helm. Cleomenes at first proposed fair and easy conditions
by his ambassadors to the Ach√¶ans; but afterwards he sent others, and
required the chief command to be settled upon him; and in other matters
he promised to agree to reasonable terms, and to restore their captives
and their country. The Ach√¶ans were willing to come to an agreement
upon those terms, and invited Cleomenes to Lerna, where an assembly was
to be held; but it happened that Cleomenes hastily marching on, and
unseasonably drinking water, brought up abundance of blood, and lost
his voice; therefore, being unable to continue his march, he sent the
chiefest of the captives to the Ach√¶ans, and putting off the meeting for
some time, retired to Laced√¶mon. This ruined the affairs of Greece, which
was just then ready to recover itself out of its disasters, and avoid
the insulting and covetousness of the Macedonians: for Aratus, whether
fearing or distrusting Cleomenes, or envying his unlooked-for
success, or thinking it a disgrace for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
him, who had commanded thirty-three years, to have a young man succeed to
all his glory and his power, and be head of that government which he had
been raising and settling so many years: he first endeavoured to keep the
Ach√¶ans from closing with Cleomenes; but when they would not hearken to
him, fearing Cleomenes's daring spirit, and thinking the Laced√¶monians'
proposals to be very reasonable, who designed only to reduce Peloponnesus
to its old model, he took his last refuge, in an action which was
unbecoming any of the Greeks, most dishonourable to him, and most
unworthy his former bravery and exploits; for he called Antigonus into
Greece, and filled Peloponnesus with Macedonians, whom he himself, when
a youth, having beaten their garrison out of the castle of Corinth, had
driven from the same country; beside he declared himself an enemy to all
kings, and hath left many dishonourable stories of this same Antigonus,
in those commentaries which he wrote: and though he declares that he
suffered considerable losses, and underwent great dangers, that he might
free Athens from the power of the Macedonians, yet afterward he brought
the very same men armed into his own country, and his own house, even to
the women's apartment. He would not endure, that one of the family of
Hercules, and king of Sparta, and one that had reformed the polity of his
country, as it were a disordered harmony, and tuned it to the plain Doric
measure of Lycurgus, to be stiled, head of the Tricc√¶ans and Sicyonians;
and whilst he fled the pulse and short coat, and, which were his chief
accusations against Cleomenes, the extirpation of wealth, and reformation
of poverty, he basely subjected himself, together with Achaia, to the
diadem and purple, to the imperious commands of the Macedonians
and their Satrap√¶. That he might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
seem to be under Cleomenes, he sacrificed the Antigonea, (sacrifices
in honour of Antigonus,) and sung P√¶ans himself with a garland on his
head, to the honour of a rotten, consumptive Macedonian. I write this
not out of any design to disgrace Aratus, (for in many things he shewed
himself vigorous for the Grecian interest, and a great man;) but out
of pity to the weakness of human nature, which, in such a person, so
excellent, and so many ways disposed to virtue, cannot attain to a state
irreprehensible.</p>

<p>The Ach√¶ans meeting again at Argos, and Cleomenes descending from
Tegea, there were great hopes that all differences would be composed. But
Aratus (Antigonus and he having already agreed upon the chief articles
of their league) fearing that Cleomenes would carry all before him, and
either win or force the multitude to comply with his demands, proposed
that, having three hundred hostages put into his hands, he should come
alone into the town, or bring his army to the place of exercise, called
Cillarabion, without the city, and treat there. </p>

<p>Cleomenes hearing this, said, that he was unjustly dealt with; for
they ought to have told him so plainly at first, and not, now he was come
even to their doors, show their jealousy, and deny him admission. And
writing an epistle to the Ach√¶ans about the same subject, the greatest
part of which was an accusation of Aratus; and Aratus, on the other side,
ripping up his faults to the assembly, he hastily dislodged, and sent a
trumpeter to denounce war against the Ach√¶ans, but not to Argos, but to
√Ügium, as Aratus delivers, that he might not give them notice enough to
make provision for their defence. Upon this, the Ach√¶ans were mightily
disturbed; the common people expecting a division of the land,
and a release from their debts:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and the chief men being on many accounts displeased with Aratus, and
some angry, and at odds with him, as the occasion of the Macedonians'
descent on Peloponnesus. Encouraged by these misunderstandings, Cleomenes
invades Ach√¶a; and first took Pellene by surprise, and beat out the
Ach√¶an garrison; and afterwards brought over Pheneon and Pentel√¶on to his
side. Now the Ach√¶ans suspecting some treacherous designs at Corinth and
Sicyon, sent their horse and mercenaries out of Argos to have an eye upon
those cities; and they themselves went to Argos to celebrate the Nemean
games. Cleomenes advertised of this march, and hoping (as it afterwards
fell out) that upon an unexpected advance to the city, now busied in
the solemnity of the games, and thronged with numerous spectators, he
should raise a considerable terror and confusion amongst them; by night,
he marched with his army to the walls, and taking the quarter of the
town called Aspis, which lies above the theatre, a place well fortified,
and hard to be approached, he so terrified them, that none offered to
resist, but agreed to accept a garrison, to give twenty citizens for
hostages, and to assist the Laced√¶monians, and that he should have the
chief command. This action considerably increased his reputation, and his
power; for the antient Spartan kings, though they many ways endeavoured
to effect it, could never bring Argos to be stedfastly and sincerely
theirs. And Pyrrhus, a most experienced captain, and brave soldier,
though he entered the city by force, could not keep possession, but
was slain himself with a considerable part of his army. Therefore they
admired the dispatch and contrivance of Cleomenes; and those that before
derided him for saying that he imitated Solon and Lycurgus in releasing
the people from their debts, and in equally dividing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
wealth of the citizens, were now persuaded, that he was the cause of the
desirable alterations in the Spartan commonwealth. For, before, they
were very low in the world, and so unable to secure their own, that the
√Ütolians invading Laconia, brought away fifty thousand slaves; so that
one of the elder Spartans is reported to have said, that "they had done
Laconia a kindness by unburdening it;" and yet, a little while after,
applying themselves to their own customs, and antient institutions, they
gave notable instances of courage and obedience, as if they had been
under the eye of Lycurgus himself, and quickly raised Sparta to be head
of all Greece, and recovered Peloponnesus to themselves. Whilst Argos was
taken, and Cleon√¶ and Philius sided with Cleomenes, Aratus was at Corinth
searching after some, who were reported to favour the Spartan interest.
The news being brought to him, disturbed him very much; for he perceived
the city inclining to Cleomenes, and the Ach√¶ans willing to be at ease;
therefore he called all the citizens into the common hall, and, as it
were undesignedly retreating to the gate, he mounted his horse that stood
ready there, and fled to Sicyon; and the Corinthians made such haste to
Cleomenes at Argos, that, (as Aratus says) striving who should be first
there, they spoiled all their horses: and Cleomenes was very angry with
the Corinthians for letting Aratus escape. And Megistones came from
Cleomenes to him, desiring him to deliver up the castle of Corinth, which
was then garrisoned by the Ach√¶ans, and offered him a considerable sum of
money; and that he answered, that "matters were not now in his power, but
he in theirs." Thus Aratus himself writes. But Cleomenes marching from
Argos, and taking in the Tr√¶zenians, Epidaurians,
and Hermioneans, came to Corinth, and blocked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the castle, which the Ach√¶ans would not surrender; and sending for
Aratus's friends and stewards, committed his house and estate to their
care and management and sent Tritimallus the Messenian to him a second
time, desiring that the castle might be equally garrisoned by the
Spartans and Ach√¶ans, and promising to Aratus himself double the pension
that he received from king Ptolemy; but Aratus refusing the conditions,
and sending his own son with other hostages to Antigonus, and persuading
the Ach√¶ans to make a decree for delivering the castle into Antigonus's
hands, Cleomenes invaded the territory of the Sicyonians, and, by a
decree of the Corinthians, seized on all Aratus's estate. In the mean
time, Antigonus, with a great army, passed Gerania; and Cleomenes
thinking it more advisable to fortify and garrison, not the Isthmus,
but the mountains called Onia, and by a long siege and skirmishes to
weary the Macedonians, than to venture a set battle, put his design in
execution, which very much distressed Antigonus; for he had not brought
victuals sufficient for his army, nor was it easy to force a way through,
whilst Cleomenes guarded the pass. He attempted by night to pass through
Lech√¶um, but failed, and lost some men; so that Cleomenes and his army
were mightily encouraged, and so flushed with the victory, that they went
merrily to supper; and Antigonus was very much dejected, being reduced to
those miserable straits. At last he designed to march to the promontory
Her√¶um, and thence transport his army in boats to Sicyon, which would
take up a great deal of time, and be very chargeable. The same time,
about evening, some of Aratus's friends came from Argos by sea, and
invited him to return; for the Argives would revolt from Cleomenes.
Aristotle was the man that wrought the revolt, and he had no hard task to persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the common people; for they were all angry with Cleomenes for
not releasing them from their debts, as they expected. Upon this
advertisement, Aratus, with fifteen hundred of Antigonus's soldiers,
sailed to Epidaurus; but Aristotle, not staying for his coming, drew
out the citizens, and fought against the garrison of the castle; and
Timoxenus, with the Ach√¶ans from Sicyon, came to his assistance.
Cleomenes heard the news about the second watch of the night, and,
sending for Megistones, angrily commanded him to go and set things
right at Argos. This Megistones was the man who passed his word for
the Argives' loyalty, and persuaded him not to banish the suspected.
This Megistones he dispatched with two thousand soldiers, and observed
Antigonus himself, and encouraged the Corinthians; pretending, that there
was no great matter in the stirs at Argos, but only a little disturbance
raised by a few inconsiderable persons. But when Megistones, entering
Argos, was slain, and the garrison could scarce hold out, and frequent
messengers came to Cleomenes for succours, he,&mdash;fearing lest the
enemy, having taken Argos, should shut up the passes, and securely
waste Laconia, and besiege Sparta itself, which he had left without
forces,&mdash;he dislodged from Corinth, and presently lost that city,
for Antigonus entered it, and garrisoned the town. He turned aside from
his direct march, and, assaulting the wall of Argos, endeavoured to break
in; and having cleared a way under the quarter called Aspis, he joined
the garrison, which still held out against the Ach√¶ans; some parts of the
city he scaled and took, and his Cretan archers cleared the streets. But,
when he saw Antigonus, with his phalanx, descending from the mountains
into the plain, and the horse on all sides entering the city, he
thought it impossible to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
his post; and therefore, with all his men, made a safe retreat behind the
wall; having in a short time raised himself to a considerable height,
and, in one march, made himself master of almost all Peloponnesus, and
lost all again in as short a time: for some of his allies presently
forsook him, and others not long after put themselves under Antigonus's
protection. His army thus defeated, as he was leading back the relicks
of his forces, some from Laced√¶mon met him in the evening at Tegea, and
brought him news of as great a misfortune as that which he had lately
suffered; and that was the death of his wife, whom he doated on so much,
that when he was most prosperous, he would ever now and then make a step
to Sparta to visit his beloved √Ügiatis.</p>

<p>This news afflicted him extremely; and he grieved as a young man
would do for the loss of a very beautiful and excellent wife; yet his
passion did not debase the greatness of his mind, but, keeping his usual
voice, his countenance, and his habit, he gave necessary orders to his
captains, and took care to secure the Tegeans. The next day he retired
to Sparta; and having at home, with his mother and children, bewailed
the loss, and finished his mourning, he presently appeared about the
public affairs of the state. Now Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, promised him
assistance, but demanded his mother and children for hostages. This, for
some considerable time, he was ashamed to discover to his mother; and
though he often went to her on purpose, and was just upon the discourse,
yet still refrained, and kept it to himself; so that she began to suspect
somewhat, and asked his friends, Whether Cleomenes had somewhat to say to
her, which he was afraid to speak? At last Cleomenes venturing to tell
her, she laughed heartily, and said, "Was this the thing that you
had often a mind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
tell me, and was afraid? Why do you not put me on shipboard, and send
this carcase where it may be most serviceable to Sparta, before age
wastes it unprofitably here?" Therefore, all things being provided for
the voyage, they went to T√¶narus on foot, and the army waited on them.
Cratesiclea, when she was ready to go on board, took Cleomenes aside
into Neptune's temple, and embracing him, who was very much dejected,
and extremely discomposed, she said thus: "Go to, king of Sparta; when
we are without door, let none see us weep, or show any passion below the
honour and dignity of Sparta, for that alone is in our own power; as
for success or disappointments, those wait on us as the Deity decrees."
Having said thus, and composed her countenance, she went to the ship with
her little grandson, and bade the pilot put presently out to sea. When
she came to Egypt, and understood that Ptolemy entertained proposals and
overtures of peace from Antigonus, and that Cleomenes, though the Ach√¶ans
invited and urged him to an agreement, was afraid, for her sake, to come
to any, without Ptolemy's consent; she wrote to him, advising him to do
that which was most becoming and most profitable for Sparta, and not,
for the sake of an old woman and a little child, always stand in fear
of Ptolemy. This character she maintained in her misfortunes. Antigonus
having taken Tegea, and plundered Orchomenum and Mantin√¶a, Cleomenes was
shut up within the narrow bounds of Laconia, and made such of the Helots,
as could pay five Attick pounds, free of Sparta, and by that means got
together 500 talents; and arming 2000 after the Macedonian fashion,
that he might make a body fit to oppose Antigonus's Leucaspid√¶, (white
shields,) he undertook a very surprising enterprize. Megalopolis was at
that time a city of itself, as big
and as powerful as Sparta, and had the forces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the Ach√¶ans and Antigonus encamping on its sides; and it was chiefly
the Megalopolitans' doing, that Antigonus was called in to assist the
Ach√¶ans. Cleomenes having a design upon this city, (no action was ever
more sudden and more unexpected) ordered his men to take five days
provision, and so marched to Sellasia, as if he intended to spoil the
country of the Argives; but from thence making a descent into the
territories of Megalopolis, and refreshing his army about Rh√¶tium, he
marched through Helicon, directly to the city. When he was not far
off the town, he sent Pantheus with two regiments to surprise the
Mesopyrgion, (the quarter between the two towers,) which he understood
to be the most unguarded quarter of the Megalopolitans' fortifications;
and with the rest of his forces he followed leisurely. Pantheus not only
surprised that place, but, finding a great part of the wall without
guards, he pulled down some places, and demolished others, and killed
all the defenders that he found. Whilst he was thus busied, Cleomenes
came up to him, and was got with his army within the city, before
the Megalopolitans knew of the surprise. At last, as soon as it was
discovered, some left the town immediately, taking with them what money
they had ready; some armed, and engaged the enemy; and though they
were not able to beat them out, yet they gave their citizens time and
opportunity safely to retire: so that there were not above 1000 persons
left in the town, all the rest flying with their wives and children,
and escaping to Messena. A great number of those that armed and fought
the enemy were saved, and very few taken, amongst whom were Lysandridas
and Thearidas, two men of great power and reputation amongst the
Megalopolitans; and therefore the soldiers, as soon as they were taken, brought them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to Cleomenes. And Lysandridas, as soon as he saw Cleomenes afar off,
cried out,&mdash;"Now, king of Sparta, it is in your power, by doing
a most kingly and braver action than you have already performed, to
purchase a considerable glory." And Cleomenes guessing at his meaning,
replied,&mdash;"What do you say, Lysandridas? sure you will not advise
me to restore your city to you again?" "It is that which I mean,"
Lysandridas replied; "and I advise you not to ruin so brave a city,
but to fill it with faithful and stedfast friends and allies, by
restoring their country to the Megalopolitans, and being the saviour
of so considerable a people." Cleomenes paused a while, and then
said,&mdash;"It is very hard to trust so far in these matters; but with
us let profit always yield to glory." Having said this, he sent the two
men to Messena with a trumpeter from himself, offering the Megalopolitans
their city again, if they would forsake the Ach√¶an interest, and be on
his side. Though Cleomenes made these kind and obliging proposals, yet
Philop√¶men would not suffer them to break their league with the Ach√¶ans;
and accusing Cleomenes to the people, as if his design was not to
restore the city, but to take the citizens too, he forced Thearidas and
Lysandridas to leave Messena. </p>

<p>This was that Philop√¶men, who was afterward chief of the Ach√¶ans,
and a man of the greatest reputation amongst the Greeks, as I have made
it appear in his own Life. This news coming to Cleomenes though he had
before taken such strict care that the city should not be plundered, yet
then being in a fury, and put out of all patience, he rifled them of all
their coin, plate, and jewels, and sent their statues and pictures to
Sparta; and demolishing a great part of the city, he marched away
for fear of Antigonus and the Ach√¶ans; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
never stirred, for they were in √Ügium at a council of war. Aratus
mounted the desk, wept a long while, and held his mantle before his
face; and at last, the company being amazed, and commanding him to
speak, he said,&mdash;"Megalopolis is ruined by Cleomenes." The assembly
was presently dissolved; the Ach√¶ans being extremely surprised at the
suddenness and greatness of the loss; and Antigonus intending to send
speedy succours, when he found his army to gather very slowly out of
their winter-quarters, he sent them orders to continue there still; and
he himself marched to Argos with a considerable body of men. The second
enterprize of Cleomenes seemed to be carried on by extreme boldness, and
unaccountable madness; but yet, in Polybius's opinion, was done upon
mature deliberation, and exact foresight; for, knowing very well, that
the Macedonians were dispersed into their winter quarters, and that
Antigonus, with his friends and a few mercenaries about him, wintered in
Argos; upon these considerations, he invaded the country of the Argives,
hoping to shame Antigonus to a battle upon unequal terms; or else, if
he did not dare to fight, to bring him into disrepute with the Ach√¶ans.
And this accordingly happened; for Cleomenes wasting, plundering, and
spoiling the whole country, the Argives, vexed at the loss, run in troops
to the palace of the king, and clamoured, that he should either fight, or
surrender his command to better and braver men. But Antigonus, as became
an experienced captain, accounting it dishonourable foolishly to hazard
his army, and quit his security, not to be abused and railed at by the
rabble, would not march out against Cleomenes, but stood fixed to the
designs which he had laid. Cleomenes, in the mean time, brought his army
up to the very walls, and having uncontrouledly spoiled the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and insulted over his enemies, drew off again. A little while after,
being advertised that Antigonus designed for Tegea, and thence to make an
incursion into Laconia, he hastily marched with his army another way, and
appeared early in the morning before Argos, and wasted the fields about
it: the corn he did not cut down with reaping-hooks and scythes, as men
usually do, but beat it down with staves made like scymeters; and with a
great deal of contempt and wanton scorn he spoiled the fields, and wasted
the country in his march; yet when his soldiers would have set Cyllabris,
the school of exercise, on fire, he hindered the attempt, reflecting,
upon serious consideration, that the outrages committed at Megalopolis
were the effects of his passion rather than his wisdom. He pretended to
make such little account of, and so much to despise Antigonus, who first
retired to Argos, and afterward placed garrisons on all the mountains
round about, that he sent a trumpeter to desire the keys of Her√¶um,
(Juno's temple,) that he might sacrifice to the goddess. Thus with a
scoff, and bitter reflection on Antigonus, and having sacrificed to the
goddess, under the walls of the temple, that was shut, he marched to
Phlius; and from thence driving out those that garrisoned Hologountum, he
marched down to Orchomenum. And these enterprizes not only encouraged the
citizens, but made him appear to the very enemies to be an experienced
captain, and very worthy of command; for, with the strength of one
city, not only to fight the power of the Macedonians, and all the
Peloponnesians; not only to preserve Laconia from being spoiled, but to
waste the enemy's country, and to take so many and such considerable
cities, is an argument of no common bravery. He that first said, "That
money was the sinews of affairs," seemed chiefly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
that saying to respect war: and Demades, when the Athenians voted that
a navy should be made ready, but had no money, said, "They should make
bread before they thought of sailing:" and the old Archidamus, in the
beginning of the Peloponnesian war, when the allies desired, that each
party's share of contributions for the war should be determined, is
reported to have said, "War cannot be kept to a set diet." For, as
well-breathed wrestlers do in time weary and tire out the most active and
skilful combatant; so Antigonus, coming to the war with a great stock
of wealth, wearied out Cleomenes, whose poverty made it difficult for
him either to provide pay for the mercenaries, or provisions for the
citizens. For in all other respects the time favoured Cleomenes; for
Antigonus's affairs at home began to be disturbed: for the Barbarians
wasted and over-ran Macedonia whilst he was absent; and at that time a
vast army of the Illyrians came down, to be freed from whose outrages,
the Macedonians sent for Antigonus, and the letters had almost been
brought to him before the battle was fought, upon the receipt of which
he presently dislodged, and left the Ach√¶ans' affairs to themselves. But
fortune that loves to determine the greatest affairs by a minute, in
this conjuncture showed such an exact niceness of time, that immediately
after the battle in Sellasia was over, and Cleomenes had lost his army
and his city, the messengers reached Antigonus. And this made Cleomenes's
misfortune more to be pitied; for, if he had forborne fighting two days
longer, there had been no need of hazarding a battle, since, upon the
departure of the Macedonians he might have had what conditions he pleased
from the Ach√¶ans. But now (as I hinted before) for want of money, being
necessitated to rely wholly on his arms, he was forced, with 20,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
(this is Polybius's account) to engage 30,000; and approving himself
an excellent commander in this difficulty, his citizens showing an
extraordinary courage, and his mercenaries bravery enough, he was
overborne by the different way of fighting, and the weight of the armed
phalanx. Besides, Phylarchus affirms, that the treachery of some about
him was the chief cause of Cleomenes's ruin. For Antigonus gave orders,
that the Illyrians and Acharnanians should march round by a secret way,
and encompass the other wing, which Eucleidas, Cleomenes's brother,
commanded; and then drew out the rest of his forces to the battle. And
Cleomenes, from a convenient rising, viewing his order, and not seeing
any of the Illyrians and Acharnanians, began to suspect that Antigonus
had sent them upon some such design; and calling for Damoteles, who was
to inspect and to provide against ambushes, commanded him carefully to
look after, and discover the enemy's designs upon his rear. </p>

<p>But Damoteles (for some say Antigonus had bribed him) telling him,
that he should not be solicitous about that matter, for all was well
enough, but mind and fight those that met him in the front; he was
satisfied, and advanced against Antigonus; and, by the vigorous charge of
his Spartans, made the Macedonian phalanx give ground, and pressed upon
them with great advantage about half a mile; but then making a stand, and
seeing the danger which the surrounded wing, commanded by his brother
Eucleidas, was in, he cried out, "Thou art lost, dear brother! thou art
lost, thou brave example to our Spartan youth, and theme of our matrons'
songs!"</p>

<p>Eucleidas's wing being thus cut in pieces, and the conquerors from
that part falling upon his battle, he perceived his soldiers to be
disordered, and unable to maintain the fight, and therefore provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
for his own safety. When he came into the city, he advised those citizens
that he met, to receive Antigonus; and as for himself, he said, which
should appear most advantageous to Sparta, whether his life or death,
that he would chuse. Seeing the women running out to those that fled
with him, taking their arms, and bringing drink to them, he entered into
his own house, and his servant, who was a free-born woman, taken from
Megalopolis after his wife's death, offering, as she used to do, to make
necessary provision for him returning from the battle; though he was very
thirsty, he refused to drink, and though very weary, to sit down; but,
armed as he was, he clapped his arm side-way to a pillar, and leaning his
forehead upon his elbow, he rested his body a little while, and ran over
in his thoughts what course he should take; and then with his friends
went presently to Gythium, where, finding ships fitted for the purpose,
they embarked. Antigonus, taking the city, treated the Laced√¶monians
courteously; and, neither affronting, nor ruining the dignity of Sparta,
but permitting them to enjoy their own laws and polity, and sacrificing
to the gods, dislodged the third day; for he heard that there was a
great war kindled in Macedonia, and that the country was spoiled by
the Barbarians; besides, he grew sick of a consumption, and continual
defluxion on the lungs; yet he still kept up, that he might return
and free his own country, and fall more gloriously upon an heap of
slaughtered barbarians. As Phylarchus says, and it is probable, he broke
a vein by shouting in the battle. In the plays, it was said, that after
the victory he cried out for joy, "O fine day!" and presently bringing up
abundance of blood, fell into a fever, and died in a short time. And thus
much concerning Antigonus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Cleomenes sailing from Cyther√¶, touched at another island called
√Ügialia, whence, as he was about to depart from Cyrene, one of
his friends, Therycion by name, a man of an haughty spirit in all
enterprizes, and high and boasting in his talk, came privately to him,
and said thus: "Sir, death in battle, which is the most glorious, we have
let go, though all heard us say, that Antigonus should never tread over
the king of Sparta, unless dead; and now, that which is next in bravery
and glory, is presented to us. Whither do we madly sail, flying that
which is near, and seeking that which is far removed? For, if it is not
dishonourable for the race of Hercules to serve the successors of Philip
and Alexander, we shall save a long voyage, by delivering ourselves up to
Antigonus, who probably surpasseth Ptolemy, as much as the Macedonians do
the Egyptians: but if we think it mean to submit to those whose arms have
conquered us, why should we choose him for our lord, by whom we have not
yet been beaten? Is it, that instead of one, we might appear meaner than
two, whilst we fly Antigonus, and flatter Ptolemy? Or, is it for your
mother's sake that you retreat to Egypt? It will indeed be a very fine,
and very desirable sight for her to be shown her son by Ptolemy's women,
now changed from a prince into an exile and a slave! Are we not still
masters of our own swords? And whilst we have Laconia in view, shall we
not here free ourselves from this disgraceful misery, and clear ourselves
to those, who at Sellasia died for the honour and defence of Sparta? Or
shall we sit lazily in Egypt, enquiring, what news from Sparta? and whom
Antigonus hath been pleased to make governor of Laced√¶mon:"&mdash;Thus
spoke Therycion; and this was Cleomenes's reply:&mdash;"By seeking
death, you coward, the most easy, and most ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
refuge, you fancy that you shall appear courageous and brave, though
this flight is baser than thy former. Better men than we have given
way to their enemies, having been betrayed by fortune, or oppressed by
multitudes; but he that sinks under labour or afflictions, the opinions
or reproaches of men, is overcome by his own effeminacy and softness: for
a voluntary death ought not to be chosen as a relief from action, but as
an exemplary action itself; and it is base either to live or die only to
ourselves. That death, to which you now invite us, is proposed only as
a release from our present miseries, but carries nothing of bravery or
profit in it. And I think it becomes both me and you not to despair of
our country; but when there are no hopes of that left, those that have an
inclination may quickly die."&mdash;To this Therycion returned no answer;
but, as soon as he could get out of Cleomenes's company, went toward the
shore, and ran himself through. But Cleomenes sailed from √Ügialia, landed
in Lybia, and, being honourably conducted through the king's country,
came to Alexandria. When he was first brought to Ptolemy, no more than
common civilities, and usual ceremonies, were paid him; but when, upon
trial, he found him a man of deep sense and great reason, and that his
plain laconic way of conversation carried a free pleasantness with it;
that he did nothing unbecoming the greatness of his birth, nor bent under
fortune, and appeared a more faithful counsellor, than those who made it
their business to please and flatter; he was ashamed, and repented that
he had neglected so great a man, and suffered Antigonus to get so much
power and reputation by ruining him. Therefore he heaped up honours and
kindnesses on Cleomenes, and gave him hopes that
he would furnish him with an army and a navy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
recover Greece, and reinstate him in his throne. Besides, he allowed
him a yearly pension of four-and-twenty talents; a little part of which
sum supplied his and his friends' thrifty temperance; and the rest was
employed in doing good offices to, and in relieving the necessities of
those that fled Greece, and retired into Egypt.</p>

<p>But the elder Ptolemy, dying before Cleomenes's affairs had received
a full dispatch, and the successor being a loose, voluptuous, and
effeminate prince, under the power of his pleasures and his women, his
business was neglected: for the king was so besotted with his women and
his wine, that balls, music, and dancing, were the only employments of
his most busy and serious hours; and the greatest affairs of state were
managed by Agathoclea, the king's mistress, her mother, and the pimp
Oinanthes. Therefore, at the first, they seemed to stand in need of
Cleomenes; for Ptolemy, being afraid of his brother Magas, who, by his
mother's means, had a great interest among the soldiers, took Cleomenes
into his cabinet council, and acquainted him with the design of taking
off his brother. He, though all were for it, declared his opinion to
the contrary, saying, "The king, if it were possible, should have more
brothers, for the better security and management of his affairs."
And Sosibius, the greatest favourite, replying, "That they were not
secure of the mercenaries whilst Magas was alive;" Cleomenes returned,
"That he need not trouble himself about that matter; for amongst the
mercenaries there were above three thousand Peloponnesians, who were his
fast friends, and whom he could command at any time with his nod." This
discourse made Cleomenes for the present to be looked upon as a man of
integrity and power; but afterwards (Ptolemy's weakness increasing his fear, as it usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
happens, where there is no judgment and wisdom at the bottom, placing
his security in jealousy and suspicion) rendered Cleomenes suspected to
the courtiers, as having too much interest with the mercenaries; and
many had this saying in their mouths, "That he was a lion amidst a flock
of sheep;" for such he seemed to be in the court, slily overlooking and
taking notice of the management of affairs; therefore, when he desired
a navy and an army from the king, his petition was rejected. But when
he understood that Antigonus was dead, that the Ach√¶ans were engaged in
a war with the √Ütolians, and that the affairs of Peloponnessus, being
now in very great distraction and distress, required and invited his
assistance, he desired leave to depart only with his friends; but could
not obtain that, the king not so much as hearing his petition, being shut
up amongst his women, and wasting his hours in debauchery and frolics.
But Sosibius, the chief minister of state, thought that Cleomenes, being
detained against his will, would grow ungovernable and dangerous, and
yet it was not safe to let him go, being an aspiring, daring man, and
well acquainted with the diseases and weakness of the kingdom; for no
presents, no gifts, could win him to compliance. But as the ox Apis,
though revelling in all possible plenty and delight, yet desires to live
as nature would provide for him, to be at liberty and frisk about the
fields, and can scarce endure to be under the priests' keeping; so he
could not brook their courtship, and tender entertainment, but, like
Achilles, </p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Whilst there, his heart did waste with secret grief,</div>
  <div class="i0">And he was eager for the noisy wars.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His affairs standing in this condition, Nicagoras,
the Messenian, came to Alexandria: a man that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
deeply hated Cleomenes, yet pretended to be his friend; for he had
formerly sold Cleomenes a fair estate, but never received the money,
because Cleomenes was either unable, (as it may be) or else, by reason
of his engagement in the wars and other distractions, had no time to pay
him. Cleomenes, seeing him landing, (for he was then walking upon the
key) kindly saluted him, and asked, "What business brought him to Egypt?"
Nicagoras returned his compliment, and told him, "That he came to bring
some excellent war-horses to the king." And Cleomenes, with a smile,
subjoined, "I wish you had rather brought pimps, whores, and pathics;
for those now are the king's chief delight." Nicagoras at the present
smiled at the conceit; but, a few days after, he put Cleomenes in mind of
the estate that he had bought of him, and desired his money, protesting,
that he would not have troubled him, if his merchandize had turned to
that account, which he thought it would. Cleomenes replied, "That he
had not a penny left of all that had been given him;" at which answer
Nicagoras being nettled, told Sosibius Cleomenes' scoff upon the king. He
caressed him for the discovery; but desiring to have some greater reason
to excite the king against Cleomenes, persuaded Nicagoras to leave a
letter written against Cleomenes, importing, that he had a design, if he
could have gotten ships and soldiers, to surprise Cyrene. Nicagoras wrote
such a letter, and left Egypt. Four days after, Sosibius brought the
letter to Ptolemy, pretending it was just then delivered him, and with a
bitter invective excited the fury of the youth. Upon this it was agreed,
that Cleomenes should be invited into a large apartment, and treated as
formerly, but not suffered to go out again. This usage was grievous to
Cleomenes; and by this unlucky accident, his hopes, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
the future, seemed to be quite dashed. Ptolemy, the son of Chrysermas, a
favourite of the king's, always carried himself fairly towards Cleomenes:
they contracted a near acquaintance, and would talk freely together about
the state. He, at Cleomenes's desire, came to him, had some discourse
with him upon a few and inconsiderable subjects, to avoid suspicion, and
made some excuses for the king; but as he went out again, not knowing
that Cleomenes followed him to the door, he very severely reprimanded
the keepers, for their carelessness in looking after so great and so
furious a wild beast. This Cleomenes himself heard; and retiring before
Ptolemy perceived it, told his friends what he had heard. Upon this they
cast off all their former hopes, and determined for violent proceedings,
resolving to be revenged on Ptolemy for his base and unjust dealing, to
have satisfaction for the affronts, to die as it became Spartans, and
not stay till, like fatted sacrifices, they were butchered; for it was
both grievous and dishonourable for Cleomenes, who had scorned to come
to terms with Antigonus, a brave warrior, and a man of action, to wait
an effeminate king's leisure, till he should lay aside his fiddle, and
end his dance, and then kill him. These courses being resolved on, and
Ptolemy happening at the same time to make a progress to Canopus, they
first spread abroad a report, that his freedom was ordered by the king;
and it being the king's custom to send presents and an entertainment
to those whom he would free, Cleomenes's friends made that provision,
and sent it into the prison, thereby deceiving the keepers, who thought
it had been sent by the king; for he sacrificed, and gave them large
portions, and with a crown upon his head feasted and made merry with his
friends. It is said, that he began the action sooner than he designed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
having understood that a servant of one of the accomplices lay abroad
with a mistress that he loved. This made him afraid of a discovery;
and therefore, as soon as it was full noon, and all the keepers drunk
and fast asleep, he put on his coat, and opening the seam on his right
shoulder, with his sword drawn in his hand, he issued forth, together
with his friends, provided in the same manner, making thirteen in all.
One of them, by name Hippotas, was lame; he followed the first onset
very well; but when afterwards he perceived that they were more slow in
their advances for his sake, he desired them to run him through, and
not ruin their enterprise, by staying for an useless, unprofitable man.
By chance an Alexandrian was then riding by the door; him they threw
off, and, setting Hippotas on horseback, ran through the narrow lanes,
and proclaimed liberty to the people; but they, it seems, had courage
enough to praise and admire Cleomenes's daring, but not one had the heart
to follow and assist him. Three of them fell on Ptolemy, the son of
Chrysermas, as he was coming out of the palace, and killed him: another
Ptolemy, the lieutenant of the city, advancing against them in a chariot,
they set upon, dispersed his guards and attendants and pulling him out
of the chariot, killed him upon the place. Then they made toward the
castle, designing to break open the prison, and take the prisoners to
their assistance; but the keepers were too quick for them, and secured
the passages. Being baffled in this attempt, Cleomenes, with his company,
roamed about the city, none joining with them, but all retreating from,
and flying his approach; therefore, despairing of success, and saying to
his friends, "That it was no wonder that women ruled over those men that
fled liberty," he excited them all to die as bravely as became his followers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and men of their glorious performances. This said, Hippotas was first,
as he desired, run through by one of the young men, and then each of
them readily and resolutely fell upon his own sword, except Pantheus,
that Pantheus that first surprised Megalopolis. This man, being a very
handsome person, and a better companion than any of the youth, the king
loved, and bade him, when he had seen him and the rest fallen, die by
their example. Pantheus walked over them as they lay, and pricked every
one with his dagger, to try whether any was alive; when he pricked
Cleomenes in the leg, and saw him turn upon his back, he kissed him, sat
down by him, and when he was quite dead, covered his carcase, and then
killed himself upon his body. </p>

<p>Thus fell Cleomenes, that great, brave man, after he had been king
of Sparta sixteen years. The news of their fall being noised through
the city, Cratesiclea, though a woman of a great spirit, could not bear
up against the insupportable weight of this affliction, but, embracing
Cleomenes's children, made grievous lamentations; but the eldest boy,
none suspecting such a spirit in a child, threw himself headlong from
the top of the house; he was bruised very much, but not killed by the
fall, and was taken up crying, and expressing his resentment for not
being permitted to destroy himself. Ptolemy, as soon as an account of
the action was brought him, gave order, that Cleomenes's body should be
flayed and hung up; that his children, mother, and the women that were
with her, should be killed. Among those was Pantheus's wife, a very fair
woman, and of a stately carriage, who had been but newly married, and
suffered these disasters in the height of her love. Her parents would not
let her embark with Pantheus presently after they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
married, though she eagerly desired it, but shut her up, and kept her
by violence at home; yet a few days after, she got a horse and a little
money, and, escaping by night, made speed to T√¶narus, where she embarked
for Egypt, came to her husband, and with him cheerfully endured to
live in a foreign country. She led Cratesiclea, as she was going with
the soldiers to execution, held up her train, and begged her to be
courageous, who of herself was not in the least afraid of death, and
desired nothing else, but only to be killed before the children. When
they were come to the place of execution, the children were first killed
before Cratesiclea's eyes, and afterwards she herself, with only these
words in her mouth; "O children, whither are you gone?" But Pantheus's
wife girding her garments close to her, and being a strong woman, without
any noise or lamentation, looked after every one that was slain, and
wound them up as well as her present circumstances would permit; and
after all were killed, dressing herself, bound her clothes close about
her, and, suffering none to come near, or be an eye witness of her fall,
beside the executioner, she courageously submitted to the stroke, and
wanted nobody to look after, or wind her up after she was dead. Thus, in
her death, the modesty of her mind appeared, and set the guard upon her
body, which she always kept when alive; and she, in the declining age
of the Spartans, shewed, that women were no unequal rivals of the men,
and was an instance of such a courage as would not sneak to the affronts
of fortune. A few days after, those that watched the hanging body of
Cleomenes, saw a very great snake winding about his head, and covering
his face, so that no bird of prey should fly at it.
This made the king superstitiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
afraid, and set the women upon several lustrations, as if he had been an
extraordinary man, and one beloved by the gods, that had been slain. And
the Alexandrians made processions to the place, and gave Cleomenes the
title of Hero, and the Son of the gods, till the philosophers satisfied
them, by saying, "That, as oxen breed bees, putrefying horses breed
hornets, and beetles rise from the carcases of dead asses, so the humours
and juices of the marrow of a man's body, coagulating, produce serpents."
And this the antients observing, appropriated a serpent rather than any
other creature to heroes. </p>

<h2>LOVE TRIUMPHANT.</h2>

<p>This piece, which concluded our author's labours as a dramatic
poet, was unsuccessful when represented, and affords very little pleasure
when perused. If we except "Amboyna," our author never produced
a play, where the tragic part had less interest, or the comic less
humour. For the faults of "Amboyna," Dryden pleaded the barren
nature of the subject, chosen not with a view to dramatic effect, but
to attain a political purpose, and the hurry of writing upon a temporary
theme. But that he should have failed, in a play avowedly
intended to crown his dramatic labours, where the story was of
his own device, and the composition at his own leisure, can only
be imputed to that occasional flatness, or cessation of the divine
influence, as an ancient would have expressed it, from which men
of the highest poetic genius are not exempted. In despite of all
cold reasoning upon this subject, the fact is irresistible, that our
capacity of exerting mental talents, is not more absolute than that
which we possess over our bodily powers. We are in each case
limited by a thousand external and internal circumstances, which
occasion the greatest and most involuntary inequalities, between
our happier and our inferior efforts, of mental abilities or of corporeal
strength. It can only be to the temporary failure of the poetic
inspiration, which, like the wind of heaven, bloweth where it listeth,
and neither to want of labour, nor to impaired talents, that
we are to attribute the inferiority of "Love Triumphant," to
almost all Dryden's other compositions.</p>

<p>The plot is unhappily chosen. For, as we have had already occasion
to notice, stories turning, or appearing to turn, upon incestuous passion,
have seldom been successful upon the modern stage<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. Davies, in
his "Dramatic Miscellanies," attributes Garrick's renouncing his intention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
of reviving the admirable old play of "King and no King,"
to the ardent passion which Arbaces conceives for his supposed
sister; and which that excellent judge suspected would not be tolerated
in our age. "Ph√¶dra and Hippolitus," though most powerfully
supported, both by actors and admirers, failed for the same
reason; and, according to Davies, even the various excellencies of
"Don Sebastian" were unable to expiate the disgust, excited by the
unpleasing discovery of his relation to Almeyda. While "Love
Triumphant" labours under this capital and disagreeable defect,
little ingenuity can be discovered in the story, abstracted from that
consideration. The king of Castile suffers his sole and only offspring
to remain in the court of a rival and hostile monarch, and
even to head armies against him, supposing himself the son of his
enemy. The virtuous Queen of Arragon cultivates and encourages
a passion, having all the moral guilt of an incestuous attachment,
between her own daughter and her supposed son. The tyrant Veramond
is the only person who acts upon rational principles
through the piece. He refuses the liberty of a rival king to the
petulant demand of Alphonso; and not very unreasonably proposes
to separate his son and daughter, before worse consequences
arose from their infamous and impudently avowed passion. But
by this very natural conduct, he gains the hatred of his wife, his
children, and his subjects:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Miranda canit, sed non credenda, poeta.</i></p>

<p>After so many and such violent stretches of probability, the author
does not deign to wind up the plot, otherwise than by a sudden
change in the temper and resolutions of Veramond, a conclusion
which he himself admits in general to be grossly inartificial, and
which in the present case is peculiarly infelicitous. The ruling
passion of Veramond seems to be a hatred of his rival Ramirez,
and a sort of instinctive antipathy to Alphonso, even when he believes
him to be his own son, just arrived from conquest in his behalf.
This hatred and aversion was not likely to be abated, by the
objects of them turning out to be father and son; nor much
soothed, by the circumstance of their making him prisoner in his
own metropolis. Yet, in this situation, moved by a few soft speeches
from Celidea, who had taken a fancy to the intended husband of
her sister, the tyrant of Arragon alters his whole family arrangements,
and habits of mind; and takes his hated foes into his family
and bosom, merely that the play may be concluded. The author
of these inconsistencies can hardly escape the censure of Aristotle,
against which he has pleaded in the preface.</p>

<p>With regard to the poetry of "Love Triumphant," it is somewhat
remarkable, that, in the most laboured scenes of this last effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
of his tragic muse, Dryden has had recourse to his discarded
mistress, Rhyme. As this could hardly arise from an alteration of
his final opinion, it may have been owing to a consciousness, that
there was some deficiency in the piece, which the harmony of
numbers might veil, though it could not supply. The turn of the
dialogue, also, is quite in our poet's early manner. The lovers, in
the first scene of the second act, burning with a horrible passion,
which they felt it death to conceal, and infamy and mortal sin
to avow, communicate their feelings to each other in alternate
couplets, like two contending Arcadians. Their horror evaporates
in antithesis, and their passion in quaint prettinesses. Witness the
speech of Alphonso:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i class="personae">Alph.</i> Oh raging, impious, and yet hopeless fire!</div>
  <div class="i0">Not daring to possess what I desire;</div>
  <div class="i0">Condemn'd to suffer what I cannot bear;</div>
  <div class="i0">Tortur'd with love, and furious with despair.</div>
  <div class="i0">Of all the pains which wretched mortals prove,</div>
  <div class="i0">The fewest remedies belong to love:</div>
  <div class="i0">But ours has none; for if we should enjoy,</div>
  <div class="i0">Our fatal cure must both of us destroy.</div>
  <div class="i0">Oh dear Victoria, cause of all my pain!</div>
  <div class="i0">Oh dear Victoria, whom I would not gain!</div>
  <div class="i0">Victoria, for whose sake I would survive:</div>
  <div class="i0">Victoria, for whose sake I dare not live.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the tragic part of "Love Triumphant" have little merit, the
comic has even less. The absurdity of the two gallants disguising
themselves, in hopes to pass for the deceased Conde upon a
mistress, who had borne him two children, is too gross for a puppet-show,
or pantomime; and there is nothing in the dialogue to attone
for the flatness, and extravagance of the plot. It may, however,
be remarked, that Sancho, a tawdry and conceited coxcomb,
the son of a Jewish usurer, and favoured by the father of his mistress,
only for his wealth, has some resemblance in manners and
genealogy to a much more pleasant character, that of Isaac in the
"Duenna."</p>

<p>It is impossible to dismiss a performance of Dryden, without
some tribute of praise. The verse, where it is employed, possesses,
as usual, all the dignity which numbers can give to language;
and the Song upon Jealousy, as well as that in the character of a
Girl, have superior merit.</p>

<p>The play was received as ill as might be; so at least we are informed
by a curious letter, preserved by Mr Malone, dated 22d
March 1693-4, in which the writer, after chuckling over the
failure of the "Double Dealer," and the absolute damnation of
"Love Triumphant," concludes, that the success of Southerne's
"Fatal Marriage" will encourage the minor poets, "and vex huffing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Dryden, and Congreve, to madness<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>." Dryden himself, it
may be noticed, says nothing in the preface concerning the reception
of the piece: all authorities, however, state it to have been
unfavourable; and thus, as Dr Johnson has remarked, this great
poet opened and closed his theatrical career with bad success; a
fact, which may secure the inexperienced author from despondence,
and teach him who has gained reputation, how little he ought to
presume on its stability.</p>

<p>"Love Triumphant" was first acted and published in 1693-4.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">MY LORD,</span></p>

<p><span class="drop-capi">T</span><span class="smcap">his</span> poem, being the last which I intend for the
theatre, ought to have the same provision made for
it, which old men make for their youngest child,
which is commonly a favourite. They, who were
born before it, carry away the patrimony by right
of eldership; this is to make its fortune in the
world, and since I can do little for it, natural affection
calls upon me to put it out, at least, into the
best service which I can procure for it; and, as it
is the usual practice of our decayed gentry to look
about them for some illustrious family, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
endeavour to fix their young darling, where he may
be both well educated and supported;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> I have herein
also followed the custom of the world, and am
satisfied in my judgment, that I could not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>made a more worthy choice. It is true, I am not
vain enough to think that anything of mine can in
any measure be worthy of your lordship's patronage;
and yet I should be ashamed to leave the
stage, without some acknowledgment of your former
favours, which I have more than once experienced.
Besides the honour of my wife's relation to
your noble house,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> to which my sons may plead some
title, though I cannot; you have been pleased to
take a particular notice of me, even in this lowness
of my fortunes, to which I have voluntarily reduced
myself; and of which I have no reason to be
ashamed. This condescension, my lord, is not only
becoming of your antient family, but of your personal
character in the world; and, if I value myself
the more for your indulgence to me, and your
opinion of me, it is because any thing which you
like, ought to be considered as something in itself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
and therefore I must not undervalue my present
labours, because I have presumed to make you my
patron. A man may be just to himself, though he
ought not to be partial; and I dare affirm, that the
several manners which I have given to the persons
of this drama, are truly drawn from nature, all perfectly
distinguished from each other; that the fable
is not injudiciously contrived; that the turns of
fortune are not managed unartfully; and that the
last revolution is happily enough invented. Aristotle,
I acknowledge, has declared, that the catastrophe
which is made from the change of will, is
not of the first order of beauty; but it may reasonably
be alledged, in defence of this play, as well as
of the "Cinna," (which I take to be the very best of
Corneille's,) that the philosopher, who made the rule,
copied all the laws, which he gave for the theatre,
from the authorities and examples of the Greek
poets, which he had read; and from their poverty
of invention, he could get nothing but mean conclusions
of wretched tales: where the mind of the
chief actor was, for the most part, changed without
art or preparation; only because the poet could not
otherwise end his play. Had it been possible for
Aristotle to have seen the "Cinna," I am confident he
would have altered his opinion; and concluded,
that a simple change of will might be managed
with so much judgment, as to render it the most
agreeable, as well as the most surprising part of the
whole fable; let Dacier, and all the rest of the
modern critics, who are too much bigotted to the
ancients, contend ever so much to the contrary. I
was afraid that I had been the inventor of a new
sort of designing, when, in my third act, I make a
discovery of my Alphonso's true parentage. If it
were so, what wonder had it been, that dramatic
poetry, though a limited art, yet might be capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
of receiving some innovations for the better? But
afterwards I casually found, that Menander and
Terence, in the "Heautontimoroumenos," had been
before me; and made the same kind of discovery
in the same act. As for the mechanic unities;&mdash;that
of time is much within the compass of an astrological
day, which begins at twelve, and ends at the
same hour the day following: that of place is not
observed so justly by me, as by the ancients; for
their scene was always one, and almost constantly
in some public place. Some of the late French
poets, and, amongst the English, my most ingenious
friend, Mr Congreve, have observed this rule
strictly; though the place was not altogether so
public as a street. I have followed the example of
Corneille, and stretched the latitude to a street and
palace, not far distant from each other in the same
city. They, who will not allow this liberty to a
poet, make it a very ridiculous thing for an audience
to suppose themselves, sometimes to be in a
field, sometimes in a garden, and at other times in a
chamber. There are not, indeed, so many absurdities
in their supposition, as in ours; but it is an
original absurdity for the audience to suppose themselves
to be in any other place, than in the very
theatre in which they sit; which is neither chamber,
nor garden, nor yet a public place of any business,
but that of the representation. For my action
it is evidently double; and in that I have the
most of the ancients for my examples. Yet I dare
not defend this way by reason, much less by their
authority; for their actions, though double, were of
the same species; that is to say, in their comedies,
two amours; and their persons were better linked
in interests than mine. Yet even this is a fault
which I should often practise, if I were to write
again, because it is agreeable to the English genius.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
We love variety more than any other nation; and
so long as the audience will not be pleased without
it, the poet is obliged to humour them. On condition
they were cured of this public vice, I could be
content to change my method, and gladly give
them a more reasonable pleasure. This digression,
my lord, is not altogether the purpose of an epistle
dedicatory; yet it is expected, that somewhat should
be said, even here, in relation to criticism; at least
in vindication of my address, that you may not be
desired to patronize a poem, which is wholly unworthy
of your protection. Though, after all, I
doubt not but some will liken me to the lover in a
modern comedy, who was combing his peruke,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
and setting his cravat before his mistress; and being
asked by her, when he intended to begin his
court, replied, "He had been doing it all this
while." Yet thus it happens, my lord, that self
will come into all addresses of this nature, though
it is the most unmannerly word of the world in civil
conversation, and the most ungrateful to all
hearers. For which reason, I, who have nothing
to boast of, but my misfortunes, ought to be the
first to banish it; especially since I have so large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
a field before me, as your inborn goodness, your
evenness of temper, your humility in so ample a
share of fortune as you possess, your humanity to
all men, and your kindness to your friends; besides
your natural and acquired endowments, and your
brotherly love to your relations. <i>Notus in fratres
animo paterno</i>, was the great commendation which
Horace gave to one of his patrons; and it is that
praise which particularly crowns your other virtues.
But here, my lord, I am obliged, in common prudence
to stop short, and to cast under a veil some
other of your praises, as the chemists use to shadow
the secret of their great elixir, lest, if it were made
public, the world should make a bad use of it.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
To enjoy our own quiet, without disturbing that
of others, is the practice of every moral man; and,
for the rest, to live chearfully and splendidly, as it
is becoming your illustrious birth, so it is likewise
to thank God for his benefits in the best manner.
It is unnecessary to wish you more worldly happiness
or content of mind, than you enjoy; but the
continuance of both to yourself, and your posterity,
is earnestly desired by all who have the honour to
be known to you, and more particularly by,</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Good news; Carlos, the old Jew, is dead.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> What Jew?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Why, the rich Jew, my father. He's gone
to the bosom of Abraham his father, and I, his
Christian son, am left sole heir. Now do I intend
to be monstrously in love.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> With whom, colonel?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> That's not yet resolved, colonel; but with
one of the court ladies. You may stand a man's
friend, Carlos, in such a business.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> You may depend on me, Sancho, because
my dependance is on you. You got plunder in the
battle; while I was hacked and hewed, and almost
laid asleep in the damned bed of honour.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Nay, I confess I am a lucky rogue, for I
was born with a caul upon my head.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> I'm sure I came bare enough into the world,
and live as barely in it.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Make me but lustily in love, and I'll adopt
thee into my fortune; but thou standest&mdash;shall I,
shall I, till all the ladies are out of sight. Here,
take that <i>billet-doux</i>, which I have pulled out by
chance from amongst twenty, that I always wear
about me for such occasions.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> But to which of them shall I deliver it?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Even to her thou canst first overtake.&mdash;Nay,
do not lose thy time in looking on't, there's no particular
direction, man. Fortune ever superscribes my
letters to the fair sex: I let her alone to find me out
a handsome mistress; and let me alone to make her
kind afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> But suppose I should happen to deliver it

with her father.</p>

shall repent it; for she will certainly fall in love

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> That's as your conscience serves you. I say
only, that your husband shall be a fool; I say not,
your children's father shall be one.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Car.</span>]</span> This is a plaguy long whisper, I

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>To them.</i>]</span> I'll be short and pithy with you.
Don Sancho,&mdash;I think they call ye,&mdash;if out of my
abundant love I should bestow my dutiful daughter
on you, what kind of husband would you make?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Husband, sennor? Why, none at all. None
of my predecessors were ever married; my father
and my mother never were, and I will not be the
first of my family that shall degenerate. I thought
my two hundred pistoles would have done my business
with Dalinda, and a little winking money with
you.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> What, would you make me a pimp to my
own daughter?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> And imagine my chastity could be corrupted
with a petty bribe?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Nay, I am not so obstinate neither against
marriage. Carlos gave me this wicked counsel, on
purpose to banish me; and, in revenge to him, I
will marry.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> I hope you'll ask her leave first?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Pho! I take that for granted; no woman has
the power to resist my courtship.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Suppose then, as before supposed; what kind
of husband would you make?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Then, to deal roundly with you, I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
run a rambling myself, and leave the drudgery of
my house to her management; all things should
go at sixes and sevens for Sancho. In short, sennor,
I will be as absolute as the Great Turk, and take as
little care of my people as a heathen god.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Now, Don Carlos, what say you?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> I'll fit them for a husband.&mdash;<span class="stage">[<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Lop.</span>]</span> Why, sennor, I would be the most careful
creature of her business; I would inspect every
thing, would manage the whole estate, to save her
the trouble; I would be careful of her health, by
keeping her within doors; she should neither give
nor receive visits; nor kneel at church among the
fops, that look one way, and pray another.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Oh abominable!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Why, thou ungrateful fellow! wouldst thou
make a slave of my daughter? And leave her no
business, that is to say, no authority in her own
house?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Ay, and to call fine young gentlemen fops
too? To lock me up from visitants, which are the
only comfort of a disconsolate, miserable, married
woman!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> An' 'twere not for fear thou shouldst beat
me, I could find in my heart to beat thee.&mdash;Don
Sancho, I have an olla at home, and you shall be

<h3>SCENE II.&mdash;<i>A Street.</i></h3>

<div class="container">
 <div class="text width35">
<p class="stagecenter"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Carlos</span> <i>before</i> <span class="smcap">Don Lopez's</span> <i>Door</i>.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> That is the door of Lopez, and Sancho
must come out this way. Now, fool, sit fast, for
thou shalt not want for pestilent advice: but first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
I must know how far thou hast proceeded with the
father and the daughter, that I may know what
drugs I must prepare for the present condition of
my patient.&mdash;Oh, the door opens already, and he
bolts out single, as I wished.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sancho</span>, <i>picking his Teeth</i>.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> What, Carlos, you have dined before me;
but, it may be, you have not fared so well.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> The best part of your entertainment, I suppose,
was the desert of the fair Dalinda after dinner;
and how, and how go matters?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Better than thou wouldst have them; thou
wouldst have put a spoke in my wheel, I know it.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> No; fortune always sets those of your admirable
understanding uppermost. But, remember,
Dalinda was once mine, however.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Thou wouldst not have me give the box
away, when I have thrown seven? Come, set upon
it what thou darest, and I'll give thee leave to do
thy worst.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> You are very confident of your good luck.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Thou knowest I have a perpetual ascendant
over thee.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> And you are sure to carry her?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> She is fond of my person; she ogled me all
dinner-time; she put her foot under the table, and
trod upon mine; and if these are not certain symptoms
of passion, the devil's in womankind.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> And her father?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> The goodest old man! he drank my health
to his daughter; and I, to comply with my obligation,
answered the challenge. There, I think, I was
with her again.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> You have no more to do but to take out a
licence.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Indeed, I have her licence for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> What, quibbling too in your prosperity?
If you let another, I shall be enraged. But you
have not told me that her father is consenting.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> In a manner; but&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> But what? is he not absolutely yours?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> There is a small demur upon the matter: in
short, he hit me in the teeth with a damnable rich
old Conde; who, I find, has been dabbling with
this covetous old hunks; but, bating him, Don
Lopez tells me I shall be the welcomest man alive.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Do you know that Conde's name?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Don something de Cardona, whom the devil
confound!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> My old acquaintance; he charged with
me in the battle, but what became of him I know
not. If he be the man, despair betimes, Sancho;
he'll revenge my quarrel, and carry her in spite of
you.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> I am cunning, you know; and I believe
he named that cursed Conde, only to draw me on
the faster.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> And do you think a gentleman can succeed
against a Conde with a woman?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Why not?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> No more than a Conde against a duke, and
so upwards;&mdash;abandon her, I say.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> No; I am resolute.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> To be the shoeing-horn for the Conde?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> I confess I would not be the shoeing-horn,
to draw him on.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> No, for that's to be a pimp for him.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Right; therefore I will leave her.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Then go back, and quarrel with her and
her father; go, I say, immediately, before your virtue
cools.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> I'll give them their own, I'll warrant them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
What, make a shoeing-horn of a man of honour? <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Sancho</span>.</span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>alone</i>]</span> If the Conde be in love, then why
should Lopez admit of Sancho for a suitor? if not,
the fool is in the right, that it was only feigned, to
draw him on. However, my advice will strike on
both sides; for, if Sancho quarrels, he's discarded;
and for the Conde&mdash;stay a little&mdash;what, if I should
play this Conde? I know him, and can mimic him
exactly; 'tis but a jest if I am discovered; and if
the Conde loves her, and she him, then I marry
her in his shape.&mdash;Oh, they are coming out to
quarrel in the open air, for the house is grown too
hot for them; but I dare not stay to see the battle,
for fear of getting blows on both sides. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Carlos</span>.</span></p>

<p class="stagecenter"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez</span>, <span class="smcap">Dalinda</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sancho</span>.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> I'll wait upon you out of my house, however.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Father-in-law, that might have been, no
more ceremonies; I'll be no shoeing-horn for any
man.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> You would not be my daughter's hindrance?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> There's no more to be said on't; but either
a bargain, or no bargain.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> A bargain, if the Conde comes not on.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Then, as he comes on, I must go off, with
a pox to you and to your daughter!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> At least it shall not be a pox of your giving.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> The Conde's pox take you then! that's an
honourable pox, descended in a right line from
Don Roderic the Goth, I'll warrant you.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Indeed, if your estate were as great as his&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Nay, for that matter, I can drop gold with
him, as little as I care for her.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> But then his title?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> I have more gold yet, to weigh down his
parchment: and then my wit against a Conde's
wit; that's for overplus; for, though I say it&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Who should not say it&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Yet I do say it, and will say it, especially
as lords go now. Come, there's no more to be said,
Lopez; but take back your trumpery, I mean your
daughter; or I'll send for the scavenger with a
dung-cart.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> This is insufferable; and by this honourable
beard&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Which I'll pull off by handfuls, if you swagger&mdash;</p>

<p>Lop. <span class="stage">[<i>Aside, to</i> <span class="smcap">Dal.</span>]</span> What shall we do with this
madman, daughter?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> You should send for an alguazil to order
him, if I were sure that the Conde would come on
again; but, since that's uncertain, go in, father, and
let me alone with him: if I make him your son-in-law,
that's punishment sufficient for him.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Well, cavalier, you may chance to hear of
me. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez</span>.</span></p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Yes, and of your daughter too, in the next
lampoon, I doubt not.&mdash;<span class="stage">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dalinda</span>.]</span> Why don't
you follow him? What do you and I together, madam
countess?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Nay, I know not.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Nor I neither.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> I hope you will not beat me. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>She looks languishingly upon him.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> I can't tell that; thou hast a damnable
kind of leer, that would provoke me to somewhat&mdash;I
say not what.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Beat me with my own hand, if I deserve
it; there 'tis for you.</p>

<p class="stagecenter">[<i>Gives him her hand, and squeezes his.</i></p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> If I should beat thee now, as thou hast deserved
richly, I could make thee satisfaction.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Indeed they say an old man should never
beat a young woman, because he cannot make her
satisfaction.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Abominable chuck! if I did not hate thee
mortally, I could be content to love thee for a
quarter of an hour or so.&mdash;Why, what's here to do?
you are at your old tricks again. Pr'ythee, sweet
devil, do not ogle me, nor squeeze my palm so
feelingly; thou dear infernal, do not.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Why, do I hurt you?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> No, but thou ticklest me to the very heart-strings,
most wickedly.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> You command me then to leave you? <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Seems to be going.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Not command you neither, not absolutely.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> I go then&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Then I do command thee. I mean to stay
a little longer. Thou hast fired my blood most
horribly with that squeezing: hast not thou the
itch? speak, damnation! I think I have got the
infection of thee. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>He shakes his hands.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> I'll go and comfort my old father for the
affronts you gave him.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> No, perverseness; I'll make thee stay: in
very spite of thy proud sex, I'll humble thee.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> But was not you a grievous man to use
him so? you shall tell me, or I break your fingers.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Not a word, to save thee from perdition; I
am as dumb as a heathen oracle.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Then I must squeeze it out of you. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Pressing his hand again.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Ah, ha! it runs through me like wild-fire. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Panting.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Did not Carlos give you this naughty counsel?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> I should not answer thee, I know it. Hartlykins!
this is just cramping a man when he's
asleep, to make him tell his dream. Let go my
hand, and Carlos did not advise me; but hold it,
and he did:&mdash;now, will you be at quiet with me?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Not till you promise me to be friends with
my father.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Well, confound thee, I am friends with him.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> And to banish Carlos for an evil counsellor.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Upon condition you'll discharge the count
from seeing you.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> No conditions: either surrender upon discretion,
or I'll put you to the sword.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Pox on thee for being so tyrannical; but I
can't help myself, and therefore I totally submit.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Now, then, you shall perceive how gracious
a princess I intend to be. My father doats upon
this count, but I despise him.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> That's a good girl; for love of me, I'll warrant
you.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> You think I coax you now.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> No, I know my own merit too well for that.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Then do what I advise you. My father has
not often seen this count; what if you should pass
for him?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Hum! I do not apprehend thee.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> A man of your wit, and be so stupid! you
shall counterfeit the count.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Counterfeit the count! that's a pure quibble;
but I can make no more on't.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> He's an old fellow, and a fool: now, you
shall take upon you to be this count, to deceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
my father; and I'll keep your counsel, and teach
you how to represent him.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Oh, now I understand you! but 'tis impossible
for me to counterfeit a fool.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> I'll warrant you; trust nature.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> A man of my sense can never hide his parts.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> No, but you may shew them. Go back to
your lodgings; I'll provide you clothes, and send
you directions in writing how to behave yourself
before my father.&mdash;One word more; be sure you
manage this in private, and shut out Carlos, lest he
should discover our intrigue.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Well, I will strive for once to get the better
of my wit, and play the natural as naturally as
I can: but you had better come yourself and teach
me, for you have put me in a pure way of taking
your instructions. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Sancho</span>.</span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Alone.</i>]</span> When I consider what has passed
between the count and me, there's little reason to
believe a man should put on a foul shirt again,
when he has put it off already, and has change of
linen by him. However, my father shall know nothing
of this disguise; for he, that sold my first
maidenhead to the lord, may sell my second to the
fool; and that would be too much in conscience,
that a woman, once in twice, should not have the
letting her own freehold. And therefore I will have
the selling of myself, and Sancho shall have the refusal
of the bargain.</p>

<p class="stagecenter"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sancho</span>, <i>habited like</i> <span class="smcap">Don Alonzo de Cardona</span>,
<i>with a hunch-back</i>, <span class="smcap">Dalinda</span> <i>meeting him</i>.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> I watched your coming at the window, and
told my father. He's coming out to welcome you.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> But if I chance to break out into a little
wit sometimes, you'll excuse my frailty.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Pugh, you are so suspicious of yourself, and
have so little reason for it. Be as witty as you can;
I fear you not.</p>

<p class="stagecenter"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Don Lopez</span>, <i>and salutes him</i>.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Noble Conde, you are welcome from the
wars. And who did best in the battle, I beseech
your honour?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Why, next my honour, one colonel Sancho
did best.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Who, Sancho? he's little better than a coxcomb.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Nay, he has too much wit; if he had as
much grace, 'twould be better for him.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> But he's your lordship's rival in my daughter.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Is he so? then make much of him, old gentleman.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> You would not have me prefer him to your
excellency?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Faith, you can hardly chuse amiss betwixt
us two; he's my other self, man.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> I make a vast difference betwixt you.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> That shall be a very good jest between you
and me another time.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] The fool's too much a fool; he's
going to discover himself, if I prevent it not.&mdash;<span class="stage">[<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Lopez</span>.]</span> Make haste, father, and put him upon the
point, or he'll give me up to Sancho.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Let Sancho be no fool, since your lordship
pleases; for he is not bound to make my daughter
any satisfaction, as you are.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> And satisfaction she shall have. What, I
hope you don't think I am a eunuch?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> Oh heaven! I shall be ruined between
them; I forgot to instruct my father not
to meddle with that point.&mdash;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez</span>.] Say no
more of it, I beseech you, sir.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>To her.</i>]</span> 'Tis for thy good; let me alone.&mdash;
You know you have injured the poor girl, my lord.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Not to my remembrance, sennor. You and
I may have quarrelled, I confess, and I think I may
have given you some hard words to-day.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> Now has he forgotten he's my lord,
and is harping upon the quarrel he had with him as
Sancho. This must end in my destruction.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Your lordship and I can have had no quarrel
to-day, for I have not seen you this twelvemonth.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> That's true; now I remember myself, you
have not.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> But that you have wronged my daughter is
manifest.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sancho</span>.]</span> Sir, I must needs speak a
word with you in private. If you love me, confess
you have enjoyed me; for I told my father so, on
purpose to make him the more condescending to
the match.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>To her.</i>]</span> A word to the wise, I understand
you. Now you shall see me top upon the old fellow
<span class="stageone">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez</span>.]</span> Well, sennor, I won't stand with
you for a night's lodging with your daughter; I
acknowledge I have been a little familiar with her,
or so: but, to make her amends, I will marry her,
and consummate with her most abundantly.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Then all shall be set right, and the man
shall have his mare again.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Carlos</span>, <i>habited like</i> <span class="smcap">Sancho</span>.</p>

too? he'll carry me away a pick-a-pack, that's certain.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> I find him now: by their whispering
and by his aukwardness, this must be Sancho;
and I'll out-face him. <span class="stageone">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lopez</span>.]</span> Sennor Don
Lopez, I am come, by your permission, to renew
my addresses to your fair daughter.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Your lordship is most welcome.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Whose lordship?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Why, one of your lordships; I know not
which, for by your backs you are both my lords.
That's as you two can agree the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Carlos</span>.]</span> Sirrah, where did you steal
that back of mine?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Sirrah, I was born with it; but what he-camel
has your mother been dealing withal, that
you are begotten in my resemblance?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> What, I hope you wont pretend to pass for
the true Conde?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> I am Don Alonzo de Cardona.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> And so am I.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> If you stay a little longer, I'll stretch your
bones, till you are as strait as an arrow.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Do not provoke me; I am mischievously
bent.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Nay, you are bent enough in conscience;
but I have a bent fist for boxing.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> And I have a strait foot for kicking. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>They come up to each other.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Here will be bloodshed immediately.&mdash;Hold,
noblemen both; will ye be content that I should
examine ye, and then stand to my award which is
the true Conde?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Well, to save Christian blood, I will.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> And, to save Jewish blood,&mdash;that is your
blood, sirrah,&mdash;I am contented too.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Carlos</span>.]</span> What command had you, my
lord, in the last battle?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> I had none; I was a volunteer, and charged
with honourable Colonel Carlos in the fight.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sancho</span>.]</span> And what command had your
lordship there?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> I had none neither; and I charged with
that rogue Carlos.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> So far they are both right, as I have
heard. <span class="stageone">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sancho</span>.]</span> And what became of you afterwards?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Now I am posed; for Carlos told me he
knew nothing of the count afterward:&mdash;Sennor, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
do not well remember what became of me, for I
was in a very great passion; but I did prodigious
things, that is certain.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lop.</span>]</span> Sennor, you may see he is a counterfeit,
because he knows nothing of himself; but
I, the true Conde, was trodden under the horses'
feet, and lay for dead above half an hour.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Well, and now I remember myself, I was
laid for dead too, for just about half a year.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dal.</span>]</span> This is the wrong lord; he can
say nothing but what the other lord has said before
him.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Then he's the likelier to be the true Conde;
for he's a fool, father.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> You see, sennor, he does not remember
what became of him, as I said before.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> How would you have a man remember,
when he was laid for dead?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> But I recovered, rogue, and pursued the
enemy.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> And I recovered, and pursued them too, for
above an hundred miles together, at full speed.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> That's farther than you needed, by three-score
miles; for 'tis but forty from the place of battle
to the city.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Yes, at full speed upon the same horse,
and never drew bit neither.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dal.</span>]</span> Help me, dear Dalinda! I am
bogged, you see.</p>

sir, let me examine them a little.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> You'll make nothing of that first Conde.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Yes, a son-in-law, I warrant you.&mdash;<span class="stage">[<i>To
them.</i>]</span> Which of you two promised me marriage?</p>

<p><i>Both.</i> I did.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Carl</span>.]</span> And did you enjoy me?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> I did enjoy her; so I did: and there I was
before you, for a false Conde, as you are.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Speak for yourself, madam, and clear your
reputation from that scandalous companion.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>With her Fan before her Face.</i>]</span> I must confess
the true Conde has enjoyed me; the more my
frailty.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> The matter mends on that side.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Now, goodman Goose-cap, who's the most a
man of honour, he, who has enjoyed a fair lady, or
he, who has only licked his lips, and gone without
her?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> I see she takes his part; this is

<p><i class="personae">Mess.</i> Do not abuse yourself, sennor; neither of

this?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> He was fairly killed, I must confess; but I

<div class="container">
 <div class="text width35">
<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Follow! whither? No plunder, when the
town was fairly taken! there's a hopeful general
to follow. The son and father are both gone away,
without providing for me, who betrayed the city to
them; a fine encouragement for virtue! Well, these
monarchs make no more of us soldiers, when their
turn is served, than we make of our old battered
horses. To put us off for stallions, is the best that
can become of us; and those indeed are my present
circumstances. Dalinda will none, and Sancho
is just mounting, if I get not between, and thrust
him off; for which purpose I have insinuated to
him that I have left Dalinda for his sake, and am
upon another scent.&mdash;&mdash;Yonder he comes: this, and
another lie which I have ready coined, will go near
to spoil his market.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sancho</span>.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Well, Carlos, the hurly burly's quite over. I
met Ramirez marching off the army; and just afterwards
appeared a fellow in a fool's coat, on horseback
with three trumpets. Herod, I think they
called him; some such Jewish name.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> A herald at arms you mean.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> It may be so; but I should have taken him
for some pardonner, for he scattered indulgences,
by handfuls, to the people; but only they paid nothing
for them.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> But did he proclaim nothing?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Oh, yes; and now I remember, he began his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
speech with, O yes, too: he proclaimed a general
pardon to all rebels, of which number, you know,
you and I, Carlos, were two ring-leaders.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Then farewell Ramirez; even trudge on by
yourself, for there is an end of my expedition. I
will lay down my arms like a dutiful subject, and
submit to his majesty, when I can rebel no longer.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Very good; and try the other touch for
Dalinda, will you?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> You know I have quitted her for your
sake, and now am altogether for&mdash;let me see, what
lady am I for?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Pump, pump, Carlos, for that's to be invented
yet.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Only out of my head a little:&mdash;'tis the dead
Count's sister; a great fortune since her brother
died, but somewhat homely: she has already made
some advances to me, or else I lie.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> And will you say <i>To have and to hold</i>, with
an ugly woman?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Yes, and <i>For better for worse</i>,&mdash;that is, for
virgin, or for whore; as you will, Sancho, who are
listing yourself into the honourable company of
cuckolds.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> What, a hero as I am, to be a cuckold?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Do not disdain your calling; Julius C√¶sar
was one before you. The Count has had her by her
own confession; so she's a nobleman's dowager, for
your comfort.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Pugh, she denied it afterwards; that was
but a copy of her countenance.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> What if it prove a copy of the Conde's
countenance? do you think she had not a bastard
by him?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> That was only a plot betwixt us, to cheat
her father.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Did her father know nothing of it?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Not a syllable.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Then, when he believed you to be the
Count, how came he to charge you with enjoying
her?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> That is something to the purpose;&mdash;but now
I think on't, 'tis nothing neither; 'tis but asking
her the question, and I know she'll satisfy me.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> And you are resolved to take her word?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Rather than yours; for you may have a mind
to have a lick at the honey-pot yourself.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Farewell; you know I have other business
upon the stocks. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Seems going out.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Stay, Carlos; I am afraid you know something
more of this bawdy business than you confess.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Fecks! what a sneaking oath is that for a
man of honour? swear me bloodily like a soldier,
if you would be believed.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Without swearing, I believe her honest;
therefore make sure of her immediately.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> That is, take a rival's counsel, and make sure
of being an antedated cuckold.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> If you won't believe me, I cannot help it.
But marry Dalinda, and be happy; for I may prevent
you, if you make not haste.</p>

credit one syllable thou sayest.</p>

he advised me to it;&mdash;and yet I will marry her,

should pay their wages, pick a quarrel with their
service, and turn them off pennyless. There is
neither sheet nor shirt in the whole family; the
lodging-rooms are furnished with loam; and bare
mattresses are the beds. The dining-room plays
the hypocrite for all the house; for all the furniture
is there. When strangers dine with us, we eat

we dine alone, 'tis all a muss<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>: they scramble for

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Now, since neither you nor I have fortunes,
what should we do together, unless we should turn
canibals, and eat up one another? But if you would
make up this foul business, and help me to that rich
fool Sancho, I say no more, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> But thou wouldst be kind to me? speak
out, for I dare not trust thee, thou art such a woman.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> You should&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> What should I?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Why, you should&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Well, well, I will believe thee, though my
heart misgives me plaguily. And therefore, in the
first place, I beg your pardon for the scandal I have
laid upon you. In the next, I restore your virginity
and take away your bastard.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> And you'll tell Sancho 'twas a forged letter?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> No doubt on't; for I wrote it to myself;
and out of revenge invented the whole story.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> But suppose, dear cousin, that Sancho should
not believe all this to be your invention; and should
still suspect the letter to be true?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> I can easily convince him, by writing the
same hand again, in which that letter was indited.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> That's an excellent expedient; but do it
now; for a woman can never be cleared too soon.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> But when you are cleared, you will forget
your promise to me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> But if I am not cleared, I cannot marry
him; nor be put in a way to keep my promise.
Come, I'll hold my hand; write upon it, I always
carry pen and ink about me.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Let me seal my affection first. <span class="stageone">[<i>Kisses her
hand.</i>]</span> Now, what should I write?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Only these words at the bottom of the note,
in the same character:&mdash;<i>This letter was wholly
forged by me, Carlos</i>. <span class="stagetwo">[He kneels and writes.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> There 'tis.&mdash;&mdash; <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Gives it her, she puts it in her pocket.</i></span></p>

<p>But now tell me truly, what made you confess a
couple of bastards? have you indeed been dabbling?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Who, I confess it! Oh thou impudent fellow!
I only soothed thee up in thy villainy, to
make thee betray thy own plot. I confessed seemingly,
to make thee confess really. Heaven and thy
own conscience know I did. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Seems to weep.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> But when you're married, you'll remember
your promise?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> What promise?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> That I should&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Should what?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Must I tell you?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> No, I'll tell you; I said you should,&mdash;and so
you shall,&mdash;be cozened in your expectation.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> I foreboded this, and yet was fool enough
to trust thee. Give me back my letter.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> What, deliver up my evidence, that's the
testimony of my virtue, and thy wickedness?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> I'll search your petticoat.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Dare but touch my petticoat, and I'll cry
out a rape against thee.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Oh thou Eve of Genesis! thou wouldst
have tempted the serpent, if thou hadst been there.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> The next news you hear is of my wedding;
be patient, and you shall be invited to the dinner.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> I say no more; but I'll go home and indite
iambics: thou shalt not want for an epithalamium;
I'll do thy business in verse. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> I could tell tales that would spoil your appetite,
both to your dinner and your bride.&mdash;You
think you are married to a vast fortune.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> A better, perhaps, than you imagine.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> For, if Sancho looks into his writings, he'll
find that my estate was mortgaged to his father.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> My father's fortune will be yours at last;

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> I'm sure I'm married without redemption!</p>

he that keeps a tame cat must be content to
be scratched a little.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> The count's sister, I hope, has claws for you
too.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> That was invented only in hopes of you,
Dalinda; though now I thank my stars that I have
missed you: for two wits without fortunes would
be like two millstones without corn betwixt them;
they would only grind upon one another, and make
a terrible noise, but no meal would follow.</p>

your lady's orders in my letter must be obeyed: I

this company.</p>

that you are to provide for?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Children.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Kneeling.</i>]</span> Mamma, your blessing.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Hey day, what's here to do? Are these the
issue of your body, Madam Bride?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Yes; and they are now your children by
the mother's side. The late Conde presents his service
to you, with these two pledges of his affection
to your wife.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Is it even thus, Dalinda?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Christian patience, son-in-law.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Christian patience! I say pagan fury. This
is enough to make me turn Jew again, like my father
of Hebrew memory.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> You may make your assault, colonel, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
danger; the breach is already made to your
hands.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Ay, the devil take him that stormed it first!</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Speak well of the dead.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Kneeling.</i>]</span> And forgive the living!</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Oh Dalinda! no more Dalinda, but Dalilah
the Philistine! Could you find none but me to practise
on?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Sooner upon you than upon any man; for
nature has put a superscription upon a fool's face,
and all cheats are directed thither.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> There's no recalling what's past and done.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> You never said a truer word, father-in-law;
'tis done, indeed, to my sorrow.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> If you could undo it, Sancho, it were something;
but, since you cannot, your only remedy is
to do it again.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> That's true; but the memory of that damned
Conde is enough to turn one's stomach to her. Do
you remember what a devilish hunch back he had,
when you and I played him?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> For that reason you may be sure she'll
loath the thought of him.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Do you think so, Carlos?</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> How can I do otherwise, when I have in my
arms so handsome, so sweet, and so charming a cavalier
as you?</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Well, I am&mdash;I know not howish; she has a
delicious tongue of her own, and I begin to mollify.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Do, Sancho: Faith, you've held it out too
long, in conscience, for so slight a quarrel; this is
nothing among great ladies, man. How many fathers
have I known, that have given their blessings
to other men's children? Come, bless them, bless
them, honest daddy&mdash;Kneel down, children.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Children.</i> <span class="stage">[<i>Kneeling.</i>]</span> Your blessing, papa. <span class="stagetwo">[<i>Children cry.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> It goes against the grain to give it them.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> For shame, Sancho, take them up; you'll
break their pretty hearts else: 'twould grieve a man's
soul to see them weep thus.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Ay, they learnt that trick of their mother;
but I cannot be obdurate, the fault was none of
theirs, I'm sure. [<i>Crying.</i>] Heaven e'en bless you,
and I'll provide for you; nay, and it shall go hard
but I'll get you some more play-fellows, if your mother
be as fruitful as she used to be.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Why this is as it should be.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Heaven reward you; and I'll study obedience
to you.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> They say, children are great blessings; if
they are, I have two great blessings ready gotten to
my hands.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> For your comfort, marriage, they say, is
holy.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Ay, and so is martyrdom, as they say; but
both of them are good for just nothing, but to make
an end of a man's life.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Lop.</i> Cheer up, son-in-law: your children are very
towardly, you see they can ask blessing already.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> If he does not like them, he may get the
next himself.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> I will not trouble the company with reading
my letter from the dead count's sister; 'tis
enough to tell you, that I loved her once, and forsook
her, because she was then no fortune. But she
has been kinder to me than I deserve; and has offered
me her brother's estate in dowry with her.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Dal.</i> Which I hope you will accept.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Yes, and release you of a certain promise to
me, without explaining.&mdash;She only recommended
to me her brother's children by Dalinda: and I think
I have taken a decent care in providing them a rich
father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> I always loved a harlot, and, now I have one
of my own, I'll e'en take up with her; for my youth
is going, and my days of whoring, I mean emphatical
whoring, are almost over. But for once, we'll
have a frolick; come, offspring, can either of you
two dance?</p>

<p><i>1 Child.</i> Yes, forsooth, father, and my sister can
sing too, like an angel.</p>

<p><i class="personae">San.</i> Then foot it featly; that you may say hereafter
you remember when your mother was first
married, and danced at her wedding.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Carl.</i> Hold a little;&mdash;you may remember too, Madam
Bride, that I promised you an epithalamium.
'Twas meant a satire; but fortune has turned it to
a jest. I have given it to the musicians, and brought
them along with me; strike up, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Our Author's connection with the Theatre only ended with
his life. The pieces, which follow, have reference to the performance
of "The Pilgrim," a play of Beaumont and Fletcher,
which was revived in 1700. Vanburgh, a lively comic writer,
who seems to have looked up to Dryden with that veneration
which was his due, added some light touches of humour, to adapt
this play to the taste of the age. The aged poet himself furnished
a Prologue and Epilogue, a Song, and Secular Masque;
and, with these additions, the piece was performed for the benefit
of Dryden. It seems dubious, whether the kind intentions of
Vanburgh and the players actually took effect in favour of our
author himself, or in that of his son. It is certain, that, if he
did not die before the representation, he did not survive it many
weeks, as the play<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> was not published till after his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>But his lamp burned bright to the close. The Prologue and
Epilogue, written within a few weeks of his death, equal any thing
of the kind which he ever produced. He combats his two enemies,
Blackmore and Collier, with his usual spirit; but with manliness
concedes, that they had attacked him in one vulnerable and
indefensible particular, where he lay open, less from any peculiar
depravity in his own taste, than from compliance with the general
licence of the age.</p>

<p>Cibber informs us, that Sir John Vanburgh, who cast the parts,
being pleased with the young actor's moderation, in contenting himself
with those of the Stuttering Cook, and Mad Englishman, assigned
him also the creditable task of speaking the Epilogue, which, as
it was so much above the ordinary strain, highly gratified his vanity.
Dryden himself, on hearing Cibber recite it, made him the
further compliment of trusting him with the Prologue also; an
honourable distinction, which drew upon him the jealousy of the
other actors, and the indignation of Wilkes in particular. This
revival of "The Pilgrim" was also remarkable, as affording Mrs
Oldfield, who had been about a year or more a mute on the stage,
an opportunity of attracting public attention in the character of
Alinda, which suited the want of confidence natural to her inexperience,
and in which she afforded that promise of future excellence,
which was afterwards so amply fulfilled.</p>

<p class="p5">OF A SCHOLAR AND HIS MISTRESS, WHO, BEING CROSSED

<hr class="r10" />

<p>In "The Pilgrim," as originally written by Beaumont and Fletcher,
one scene is laid in a mad-house, where the humours of the different
persons confined are described with some pleasantry. Amongst others is
introduced a Scholar, who has solicited dismission from his confinement,
and who, after having been carefully examined by two gentlemen, whom his
patron had appointed to visit him, is on the point of being discharged
as possessed of his perfect understanding. The Dialogue, which follows,
probably formed the introduction to our Author's Song.</p>

<p>Here it seems probable the following Mad Song, betwixt the
Scholar and his Mistress, was introduced. Probably the Dialogue
sustained some alterations in the action, to render the introduction
of Phillis more natural; for, in the original, the Scholar, far
from having lost his senses by being crossed in love, disclaims acquaintance
with the passion during his previous examination.</p>

</div>

<p>This passage is retained in "The Pilgrim," as altered by Sir John
Vanburgh; so that it does not appear what alterations were made, to
accommodate the Song to the Scholar's previous appearance. The idea of
the character is copied from the story told by the Curate, in the First
Chapter of the Second Part of the Adventures of the Knight of La Mancha,
and applied by him to the relapse of that doughty champion.</p>

<h2><span class="smaller">THE</span><br />

SECULAR MASQUE.</h2>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>The moral of this emblematical representation is sufficiently
intelligible. By the introduction of the deities of the chace, of
war, and of love, as governing the various changes of the seventeenth
century, the poet alludes to the sylvan sports of James the
First, the bloody wars of his son, and the licentious gallantry
which reigned in the courts of Charles II. and James his successor.</p>

<p>James I. was inordinately attached to the sports of the chace:
it was indeed the only manly passion which our British Solomon
ever manifested; his dress was of the forest-green, and his only
severity was in executing the game-laws<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. Able hunters were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
bribes by which the English courtiers endeavoured to secure his
favour<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>, while he was yet but king of Scotland; and, in England,
his perpetual hunting expeditions were censured by his prelates<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>,
and their oppressive duration deprecated by his subjects, who, to
render their complaints more palatable, contrived, upon one occasion,
to make a favourite hound convey a hint of the burthen,
which his long residence at a hunting seat imposed upon the
neighbourhood<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. Even in the most advanced state of his age and
imbecility, when unable to sit on horseback without assistance, he
contrived to pursue the chace by being laced or tied up in his
saddle! When we add to this vehement passion for hunting, the
spirit of extravagant dissipation, which discharged itself "in
shows, sights, and banquetings, from morn to eve<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>," where even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
the ladies abandoned their sobriety, the age of James might well
be characterised, as in the Masque,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">A very merry, dancing, drinking,</div>
  <div class="i0">Laughing, quaffing, and unthinking time.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To show how justly the middle part of the seventeenth century
was characterised, as under the influence of Mars, we have only to
mention the great civil war, which so long ravaged the whole
kingdom.</p>

<p>The manners of the court of Charles II., so notoriously dissolute
and licentious, when, as our author says in the Epilogue,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Whitehall the naked Venus first revealed,</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>amply vindicate Dryden for placing the period in which they were
fashionable under the dominion of the queen of Cyprus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>The moral, by which the whole masque is winded up, was sadly
true. The frivolity of James the First's sports would have been
admitted by the sapient monarch himself&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">His sport had a beast in view.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it is less credible, were it not a historical fact, that the
wars of Charles the First "brought nothing about;" since royal
prerogative, and popular encroachment, far from being adjusted
by so many years bloodshed, were as much themes of mutual dissention
betwixt the Court and the House of Commons in the
reign of Charles II. as during that of his father. But so bloody
a lesson was not entirely lost. The contending parties at the Revolution
lived too near that eventful period, not to be aware
of the direful consequences of civil war, and thence, by mutual
concession, were determined to avoid the repetition of similar
calamities. The nation gained by the compromise; for freedom
is always benefited by the equal balance of contending factions,

<p>From the "Secular Masque" being performed in the beginning
of the year 1700, it appears, that, by a blunder, or rather confusion
of ideas, the century was supposed to terminate with 1699;
in other words, a hundred years were considered as accomplished
when the hundredth was just commenced:&mdash;an error of calculation
which, though it could not puzzle a horse-jockey, who, if
he was to ride twenty miles, would hardly think he had accomplished
the match by riding nineteen, did, nevertheless, find patrons
in the year 1800, though hardly any of such account as
Dryden.</p>

<p>The original music of the Masque was very much approved. It is
mentioned in the Travels of John Buncle. Mr Malone believes
Daniel Purcel to have been the composer. It was set anew by
Dr Boyce, and afterwards revived with success at Drury-Lane in
1749. The hunting song was long popular.</p>

<h2>EPILOGUE<br />

<span class="smaller">TO</span><br />

THE PILGRIM.</h2>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>This epilogue bears chiefly reference to the violent controversy,
which, about this time, arose between the favourers of the drama
and Jeremy Collier, who, in 1698, published "A short View of
the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage;"&mdash;"I believe,"
says Johnson, "with no other view, than religious zeal,
and honest indignation.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> He was formed for a controvertist; with
sufficient learning, with diction vehement and pointed, though often
vulgar and incorrect, with unconquerable pertinacity, with wit
in the highest degree keen and sarcastic, and with all those powers
exalted and invigorated by just confidence in his cause.</p>

<p>"Thus qualified, and thus incited, he walked forth to battle,
and assailed, at once, most of the living writers, from Dryden to
Durfey. His onset was violent. Those passages which, while they
had stood single, had passed with little notice, when they were accumulated
and exposed together, excited horror. The wise and
the pious caught the alarm; and the nation wondered why it had
so long suffered irreligion and licentiousness to be openly taught at
the public charge."&mdash;<cite>Life of Congreve.</cite></p>

<p>Dryden had his personal share of rough treatment in this indiscriminate
attack upon dramatic profligacy. But it is creditable to
him, that, whatever his feelings of resentment might be, he was too
much conscience-struck to attempt a defence of what was really
indefensible. "I shall say the less of Mr Collier, because in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
many things he has taxed me justly; and I have pleaded guilty to
all thoughts and expressions of mine, which can be truly argued
of obscenity, profaneness, or immorality, and retract them. If
he be my enemy, let him triumph; if he be my friend, as I have
given him no personal occasion to be otherwise, he will be glad of
my repentance. It becomes me not to draw my pen in the defence
of a bad cause, when I have so often drawn it for a good
one." <cite>Preface to the Fables.</cite></p>

<p>This candid avowal, and the coincidence of their political sentiments,
(for Collier was a rigid Non-juror,) did not save Dryden
from some oblique thrusts in an Answer published by Collier to
the Vindications of Congreve and Vanburgh, who, less patient or
prudent than our poet, had stepped forward to assert the correctness
of their dramatic writings. These passages in the "Defence
of the Short View," which was published in 1699, seem to
have incited our poet to put himself upon his defence, or at least
to offer the best apology he could, by throwing upon the gay
court of Charles the scandal of importing the open profligacy,
which the poet insists had corrupted the stage, instead of being derived
from thence. Lord Lansdowne, in a prologue to the "Jew
of Venice," when revived, took the freedom to dissent from Dryden
and Collier; and, by exculpating both the theatre and court, to
throw the whole blame upon the public at large:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Each in his turn, the poet and the priest,</div>
  <div class="i0">Have viewed the stage, but like false prophets guessed</div>
  <div class="i0">The man of zeal, in his religious rage,</div>
  <div class="i0">Would silence poets and reduce the stage;</div>
  <div class="i0">The poet, rashly to get clear, retorts</div>
  <div class="i0">On kings the scandal, and bespatters courts.</div>
  <div class="i0">Both err: for, without mincing, to be plain,</div>
  <div class="i0">The guilt's your own of every odious scene;</div>
  <div class="i0">The present time still gives the stage its mode;</div>
  <div class="i0">The vices, that you practise, we explode.</div>
  <div class="i0">We hold the glass, and but reflect your shame,</div>
  <div class="i0">Like Spartans, by exposing to reclaim.</div>
  <div class="i0">The scribbler, pinched with hunger, writes to dine,</div>
  <div class="i0">And to your genius must conform his line;</div>
  <div class="i0">Not lewd by choice, but merely to submit:</div>
  <div class="i0">Would you encourage sense, sense would be writ.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is, in every case of this kind, much partial accusation.
The court, stage, and public at large, have a mutual action and
re-action on the manners of each other. If the habits of a
court be licentious, the poet will hardly venture to paint them
noble and innocent; but it will depend upon the extent which
that licence has attained amongst his audience at large, whether
he represents the courtly vices in gay, or in disgusting and odious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
colours. In any case, the dramatist, who degrades himself by indecency,
has little personal apology; for, if he has condescended
to blot his pages with filth, it avails but little where he has
gathered it.</p>

<p>Collier's attack on the stage was attended with good consequences,
which that active disputant lived to witness: indecencies
were no longer either fashionable or tolerated; and, by degrees,
the ladies began to fill the boxes at a new play, without either
the necessity of wearing masks, or the risk of incurring censure.
Later times have carried this laudable restraint still farther;
till, at last, if we have lost almost all the wit of our predecessors,
we at least have retained none of their licentiousness.</p>

<p>The following verses appear upon Dryden's death, in the "State
Poems," vol. iii. founded upon his controversy with Sir Richard
Blackmore and Collier, which so immediately preceded that
event:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">John Dryden enemies had three,</div>
  <div class="i0">Sir Dick, old Nick, and Jeremy:</div>
  <div class="i0">The doughty knight was forced to yield,</div>
  <div class="i0">The other two have kept the field;</div>
  <div class="i0">But had his life been something holier,</div>
  <div class="i0">He'd foiled the Devil and the Collier.</div>

Gower and Leveson. He was second son of Sir Thomas Gower,
bart., and succeeded to the title and estate, by the death of his
nephew, Sir Edward Gower, in the year before. He was a keen
whig, and distinguished himself, both by his attachment to Monmouth,
and his zeal for the Revolution; but his alliance with
Lawrence Earl of Rochester, whose eldest son, Lord Hyde, had
married his daughter, might smooth our poet's access to his favour;
since Rochester is distinguished as his constant patron. Dryden
also refers to former passages of intimacy between him and Sir
William. Above all, we are to suppose that, in admiration of
our author's poetical talents, Sir William Gower was capable of
drowning every unfavourable recollection of his political tenets.
Sir William Leveson Gower is ancestor of the present Marquis of
Stafford.</p></div>

failure of "Albion and Albanius" occasioned, had brought out the
"Prophetess," of Beaumont and Fletcher, shortened and altered
into a musical piece, which was set by the famous Purcell. Dr.
Burney has sanctioned the compliment, which Dryden bestows
upon it. There is something in our author's turn of expression,
which may lead us to infer, that he was but a recent convert to
the English school of music. Sir John Hawkins seems to be mistaken,
in placing this opera posterior to that of "Prince Arthur."

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> We have often occasion, in these notes, to mention the Marquis
of Halifax. He was originally Sir George Saville, Baronet; but, being
early characterized by unmatched dexterity in political intrigue, he
successively attained the rank of Viscount, Earl, and, in 1682, Marquis
of Halifax. He acted alternately for the people against the Crown, and
for the Crown against the people; for he delighted in nice and delicate
strokes of policy, and in balancing, by a slight but well-applied
exertion, the sinking against the rising faction. Hence he was accounted
the head of the little faction called Trimmers; and hence his counsels
became particularly acceptable to Charles II., whose administration he
guided, as Lord Privy Seal, during the last years of that monarch's
life. The king had no mind that the high-flying tories should attain an
absolute predominance; for he feared his brother, who had placed himself
at their head, and he loved Monmouth, who was the object of their most
violent hatred. Still less could he be supposed to favour the whigs,
whose ranks contained many determined republicans. A minister, therefore,
whose ingenious and versatile councils could enable him to check the
triumph of the tories, without too much encouraging the whigs, was a
treasure to him,&mdash;and just such a minister was Halifax. Our author
therefore dedicates to him, with great propriety, a piece written for
Charles, when Halifax was his favourite minister; and the subjects of
eulogium are chosen with Dryden's usual felicity. Some allowance must
doubtless be made, for the indispensible obligation which compelled a
dedicator to view the conduct of his patron on the favourable side. Such
an unfortunate wight cannot be reasonably tied down to uniformity of
sentiment in different addresses. The character of Dryden's immediate
patron was always his cue for praise: if he stood forward against a
predominant party, he was necessarily Cato, the most virtuous of men; if
he yielded to the torrent, he was Phocion or Cicero, and Cato was a fool
to him. With the few grains of allowance which his situation required,
Dryden's praise of Halifax is an honest panegyric. It is certain, his
wisdom prevented a civil war in the last years of the reign of Charles,
and indirectly led the way to a bloodless revolution. The age in which he
lived was therefore so far indebted to him, as our author has elegantly
said, for the lives of husbands and of children, for property unviolated,
and wealth undiminished. Nor does the present owe him less; for, when is
it that a government, erected by a party successful in civil dissention,
does not far exceed their just, and even their original pretensions? The
parties had each founded their plea and their pretensions upon sacred
and integral parts of the constitution, as the contending factions of
the Jews occupied, the one the temple, and the other the palace of
Jerusalem. In a civil war, one bulwark or other must have fallen with the
party which it sheltered; and it was only the Revolution of 1688, which,
leaving both whig and tory in full strength, compelled them mutually to
respect the constitutional vantage-ground assumed by each other.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Lord Halifax was unquestionably a man of wit; and we
have some tolerable bon mots of his, handed down by his contemporaries.
Burnet says, "The liveliness of his imagination was always too hard
for his judgment. A severe jest was preferred by him to all arguments
whatever; and he was endless in consultations; for when, after much
discourse, a point was settled, if he could find a new jest to make
even that which was suggested by himself ridiculous, he could not hold,
but would study to raise the credit of his wit, though it made others
call his judgment in question." We may not, perhaps, refine too far in
supposing, that the bishop was not always able to estimate the policy of
this subtle statesman. It was more frequently his wish to avoid taking
decisive steps than to recommend them; and what could more effectually
retard violent councils than the conduct remarked by Burnet, or what
argument would have weighed with Charles II. like a keen jest?</p></div>

along a smooth table, something on the principle of billiards. The
allusion seems to be the same as if a modern poet had said, that a feeble
player at billiards runs no risk of pocketing his own ball. The reader
will find a variety of passages concerning this pastime in the notes of
the various commentators upon a passage in the "Merry Wives of Windsor,"
where Slender enumerates among the contents of his pocket, when picked
by Pistol, "two Edward shovel-boards," that is, two broad shillings
of Edward VI. used for playing at this game. In some old halls the
shovel-board table is still preserved, and sometimes used.</p></div>

like his predecessor, an enemy to France, and maintained the privileges of
the Holy See, both in the point of the regale, and in refusing to grant bulls
to those French bishops who had signed the formulary of 1682, by which the
Pope was declared fallible, and subject to the decrees of a general council.
His death took place during the congress of 1690. It was therefore a recent
event when this play was first represented, and the disposition of his successor,
towards the French or Imperial Courts, was matter of anxious speculation
to the politicians of the day.</p></div>

Thor the god of war, were worshipped by the Saxons with probably the same
attributes ascribed to them as in Denmark and Sweden. The casting of
lots is mentioned by Alfred in his version of Bede, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pluton mid tanum</i>,

<p>This extract is perhaps longer than necessary; but, independently of
its extreme beauty, it serves to justify the observation in the text, that
Dryden had the recollection of Hengo strongly in his memory while
composing the character of Cleonidas. Both are extenuated by hunger,
and both killed insidiously by a cowardly enemy; and the reader will
discover more minute resemblances to the very dialogue of Beaumont
and Fletcher on perusing p. 209, and pp. 324, 325. I do Dryden no
injury in ascribing a decided superiority to the more ancient dramatists.]</p>

Southerne's play, called the "Wife's Excuse," to the Honourable Thomas
Wharton.</p>

<p>"These, sir, are capital objections against me; but they hit very few
faults, nor have they mortified me into a despair of pleasing the more
reasonable part of mankind. If Mr Dryden's judgment goes for any thing,
I have it on my side; for, speaking of this play, he has publicly said,
"the town was kind to Sir Anthony Love; I needed them only to be just to
this;" and to prove there was more than friendship in his opinion, upon
the credit of this play with him, falling sick last summer, he bequeathed
to my care the half of the last act of his tragedy of "Cleomenes;" which,
when it comes into the world, you will find to be so considerable a
trust, that all the town will pardon me for defending this play, that
preferred me to it. If modesty be sometimes a weakness, what I say can
hardly be a crime: in a fair English trial, both parties are allowed to
be heard; and, without this vanity of mentioning Mr Dryden, I had lost
the best evidence of my cause."</p>

<p>I cannot but remark a material difference between this quotation,
as here quoted from the 8vo edition of Southerne's Plays, 1774, and as

its being acted; so that none can tell when it shall be played."</p>

<p>"I told you in my last," says the same writer in the following month,
"that none could tell when Mr Dryden's "Cleomenes" would appear. Since
that time, the innocence and merit of the play have raised it several eminent
advocates, who have prevailed to have it acted; and you need not doubt
but it has been with great applause."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Cibber has thus described Mrs Barry at the time when she was honoured
by this high compliment from Dryden:</p>

<p>"Mrs Barry was then (in 1690) in possession of almost all the chief
parts in tragedy: With what skill she gave life to them, you may judge
from the words of Dryden in his preface to "Cleomenes." I perfectly
remember her acting that part; and, however unnecessary it may seem to
give my judgement after Dryden's, I cannot help saying, I do not only
close with his opinion, but will venture to add, that though Dryden has
been dead these thirty-eight years, the same compliment to this hour
may be due to her excellence. And though she was then not a little past
her youth, she was not till that time fully arrived to her maturity of
power and judgment. From whence I would observe, that the short life
of beauty is not long enough to form a complete actress. In men, the
delicacy of person is not so absolutely necessary, nor the decline of it
so soon taken notice of. The fame Mrs Barry arrived at, is a particular
proof of the difficulty there is in judging with certainty from their
first trials, whether young people will ever make any great figure in a
theatre. There was, it seems, so little hope of Mrs Barry at her first
setting out, that she was at the end of the first year discharged the
company, among others that were thought to be a useless expence to it. I
take it for granted, that the objection to Mrs Barry at that time must
have been a defective ear, or some unskilful dissonance in her manner
of pronouncing. But where there is a proper voice and person, with the
addition of a good understanding, experience tells us, that such defect
is not always invincible; of which not only Mrs Barry, but the late
Mrs Oldfield, are eminent instances,&mdash;Mrs Barry, in characters
of greatness, had a presence of elevated dignity; her mien and motion
superb, and gracefully majestic; her voice full, clear, and strong, so
that no violence of passion could be too much for her; and when distress
or tenderness possessed her, she subsided into the most affecting melody
and softness. In the art of exciting pity, she had a power beyond all
the actresses I have yet seen, or what your imagination can conceive. Of
the former of these two great excellencies, she gave the most delightful
proofs in almost all the heroic plays of Dryden and Lee; and of the
latter, in the softer passions of Otway's Monimia and Belvidera. In
scenes of anger, defiance, or resentment, while she was impetuous and
terrible, she poured out the sentiment with an enchanting harmony;
and it was this particular excellence for which Dryden made her the
above-recited compliment upon her acting Cassandra in his "Cleomenes."
But here I am apt to think his partiality for that character may have
tempted his judgment to let it pass for her master-piece, when he could
not but know there are several other characters in which her action
might have given her a fairer pretence to the praise he has bestowed
upon her for Cassandra: for in no part of that is there the least ground
for compassion, as in Monimia; nor equal cause for admiration, as in the
nobler love of Cleopatra, or the tempestuous jealousy of Roxana. 'Twas in
these lights I thought Mrs Barry shone with a much brighter excellence
than in Cassandra. She was the first person whose merit was distinguished
by the indulgence of having an annual benefit-play, which was granted to
her alone, if I mistake not, first in King James's time; and which became
not common to others, till the division of this company after the death
of King William's Queen Mary. This great actress died of a fever towards
the latter end of Queen Anne; the year I have forgot, but perhaps you
will recollect it by an expression that fell from her in blank verse, in
her last hours, when she was delirious, viz.</p>

<p>"And yet (says Antony Aston, in his curious 'Supplement to Cibber's
work,') this fine creature was not handsome, her mouth opening most on the
right side, which she strove to draw t'other way, and at times composing her
face, as if sitting to have her picture drawn. Mrs Barry was middle-sized,
and had darkish hair, light eyes, dark eye-brows, and was indifferently plump.
She had a manner of drawing out her words, which became her, but not Mrs
Bradshaw and Mrs Porter, her successors. Neither she, nor any of the actresses
of those times, had any tone in their speech, so much lately in use. In
tragedy she was solemn and august; in free comedy, alert, easy, and genteel;
pleasant in her face and action; filling the stage with variety of gesture.
She was woman to Lady Shelton, of Norfolk, (my godmother,) when
Lord Rochester took her on the stage, where for some time they could make
nothing of her. She could neither sing nor dance, no not in a country-dance."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Malone</span>,

of which they were probably themselves conscious, pretended, that,
envious of the reputation which Creech acquired by his translation
of Lucretius, Dryden insidiously pushed him on to attempt a
version of Horace, a task for which he was totally unfit, and by
which he forfeited all the credit he had gained. The accusation is
thus stated by Tom Brown, and may serve for a specimen of the
under-bred petulance in which he indulges.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Bays.</i> "I have a certain profound stratagem still behind, my
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sacra Anchora</i> I call it, which is only to be made use of upon
extraordinary occasions, and which I was never forced to employ
but once in my time, and is as follows: When any young author
has been so fortunate in his first undertaking, as to win himself
the applause of all the world, so that 'tis impossible for one to
ruin his reputation, without running the hazard of having his
throat cut by all sort of company, I am as forward as the best of
them all to commend his ingenuity, to extol his parts, and promise
him a copy of verses before his book, if he honours the world
with a second edition.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Crites.</i> "Very good.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Bays.</i> "At the same time I privately feel his pulse, and examine
the nature, and inclination of the beast. If he chances to
be a little saturnine like myself, I set him upon a gay undertaking,
where 'tis the devil and all of ill luck if he does not ship-wreck
all his former credit. But, if he proves a man of a brisk and
jolly temper, I persuade him of all loves to make an experiment
of his abilities upon some serious solemn subject; tell him, if ever
he expects to be saved, he must out of hand do justice to the
Psalms and Canticles, which work he's as incapable to manage,
egad, as little David was to fight in Saul's armour. Thus, gentlemen,
by engaging the author in a province, where he has not
stock enough to carry on the plantation, I never fail one way or
other to compass my designs, and, at long-run, to defeat my competitor.</p>

<p><i class="personae">Crites.</i> "Why, Mr Bays, this is like enjoining a painter, that
has a good fancy at drawing of Saracens' heads, and grotesque figures
only, to draw you a Venus or an Adonis, where he must

honest translator of Lucretius with this profound piece of policy:

all expectation, and, what was a mighty matter, it suited as pat as
might be with the philosophy of the town that was then in fashion. Now,
to undermine and ruin him to all intents and purposes, I took these
measures. I flatter, hug, and caress him, like an Achitophel as I was;
after the strangest manner imaginable, profess all the respect and
friendship in the world for him; tell him that providence had certainly
reserved him for working miracles in poetry; and that I had some ancient
prophecies by me at home, which declared him to be the very person that
was to deliver the immortal writers of former ages out of that Algerine
captivity they had so long laboured under&mdash;</p>

those Irish atoms of Lucretius into so regular, and well-disciplined an
army, could raise such harmony out of a dull unmusical philosopher, how
glorious and exalted would his attempts be upon Horace, or what might we
not expect from so advantageous, so promising an undertaking. And so,
gentlemen, with the help of a little incense and flattery, I so cajoled
this √Üsop's crow, that he presently dropt his Epicurean cheese out of
his mouth, to sing one of his unmusical ill-turned Odes of Horace. I
persuaded this Welch courser to leave his ragged unaccessible precipices,
where there was no coming after him, to try his strength and feet upon
good plain ground, where an English vinegar horse, I knew, would easily
distance him." <cite>The Reasons of Mr Bayes changing his Religion considered

<p>Shields, or whoever wrote Creech's Life, in the collection to which
Theophilus Cibber gave his name, has not only adopted this tale of
scandal, but has added, that the great contempt expressed by Dryden for
the translation of Horace, gave the author a shock, from which he never
recovered, and, in short, occasioned his falling into low-spirits, and
finally committing suicide. The passage, to which this note refers, is
sufficient to clear our author from so gross and scandalous a reproach.
It shews that after the publication of Creech's Horace he continued,
in the most public manner, not only to speak kindly and respectfully
of the translator, but to stimulate him to new exertions. It is hence
evident, that no breach of friendship took place between them on this
occasion; far less could Dryden have driven him to despair by harshness
or contempt. The inference, that Dryden urged Creech to attempt Horace,
because he foresaw his failure, seems the unfounded deduction of calumny
and envy. In the dedication to the Translation of Horace, which is
addressed to our author, Creech himself bears the following strong
testimony to the liberality of Dryden's sentiments. </p>

<p>"'Tis you, sir, that have advanced our dramatic to its height, and
showed that epic poetry is not confined to Italy and Greece. That you
are honoured by the best, and envied by others, proclaims excellency
and worth; for, true honour is built only upon perfection; and envy, as
it is as sharp sighted, so 'tis as soaring as an eagle; and who ever
saw it stoop at a sparrow or a wren? and that candour and goodness have
the greatest share in your composition, I dare appeal to every one whom
you have any way favoured with your conversation; these so fill your
mind, that there is no room left for pride, or any disobliging quality.
This appears from the encouragement you are ready to give any tolerable
attempts, and reach out a helping hand to all those who endeavour to
climb that height where you are already seated. Even this owes its
completion to those smiles which you condescended to bestow upon some
parts of it, and now ventures to appear a <i>second</i> time, where at first
it found a favourable entertainment." </p>

<p> The reader will observe that this dedication is prefixed to the
<i>second</i> edition of the Translation of Horace; a circumstance
which confutes the assertion that Dryden ridiculed the work, and indeed
the whole of a tale, so malignantly invented by slander, and repeated by
credulity.</p></div>

Dryden; his son, lord Cranbourne, was grandfather of James,
the fourth earl; and therein consisted the relationship between
Dryden's sons, and the family of his patron, to which it is somewhat
difficult, in modern days, to give an exact name.</p></div>

modern ideas of good breeding, seems to have been an air frequently
assumed by the beaus of the seventeenth century. In a
play by Killigrew, called the "Parson's Wedding," we have this
direction: "Enter Jack Constant, Will Sad, Jolly, and a footman:
they comb their heads, and talk." Our author alludes to
the same fashion, in the Prologue to the "Conquest of Grenada,"
Part II.</p>

had his critics in all ages, who, like the inexpert tinker, have generally made
two holes in patching one. In the end of the seventeenth century, his plays
were usually acted in a sophisticated state, as altered by Tate, D'Avenant,
Crowne, Ravenscroft, and others. The last, in the preface to his alteration of
"Titus Andronicus," has the impudence to say, "That if the reader will
compare the old play with his copy, he will find that none in all that author's
works ever received greater alterations or additions, the language not only
refined, but many scenes entirely new, besides most of the principal characters
heightened, and the plot much increased."</p></div>

1700; Dryden died on the 1st of May following. The play was advertised
for publication in the London Gazette of 17th June, 1700. The following
is the full title:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Pilgrim, a Comedy, as it is acted at the Theatre-royal in Drury-lane,
written originally by Mr Fletcher, and now very much altered, with
several additions; likewise, a Prologue, Epilogue, Dialogue, and Masque,
written by the late great poet, Mr Dryden, just before his death, being
the last of his works. Printed for Benjamin Tooke, near the Middle Temple
Gate, in Fleet-street. 1700."</p>

<p>In the published copy our author is mentioned as dead:&mdash;"<i>Governor</i>. I
hope before you go, sir, you'll share with us an entertainment, the late great
poet of our age prepared to celebrate this day." But this, as Mr Malone
observes, was probably an addition, after Dryden's death had taken place.
Gildon, in his "Comparison between the Stages," seems to say that the
play was performed for the benefit of Dryden's <em>son</em>; probably, because in
his father's extreme illness, or upon his death, his son would naturally draw
the profits. On the whole, it seems probable, that Dryden survived the
performance of the play; as it is presumable that "The Secular Masque,"
being intended to solemnise the supposed termination of the century, was
brought out as soon as possible in the new year.</p>

in England during the seventeenth century. Tom Dove, although
equipped with a name not very expressive of his properties, seems
to have been a bear of great celebrity. Dryden honours him by
another notice in the second Prologue on the Union of the Companies:</p>

<div class="container">

  <div class="i0">They roar so loud, you'd think, behind the stairs,</div>

he was not witty himself, was the cause of more wit in others than
most who have favoured the world with their writings. In his
Satire against Wit, he had proposed a sort of mint, in which the
works of the witty should be purified and re-coined:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Tis true, that, when the coarse and worthless dross</div>
  <div class="i0">Is purged away, there will be mighty loss:</div>
  <div class="i0">Even Congreve, Southerne, Manly, Wycherly,</div>
  <div class="i0">When thus refined, will grievous sufferers be:</div>
  <div class="i0">Into the melting-pot when Dryden comes,</div>
  <div class="i0">What horrid stench will rise, what noisome!</div>
  <div class="i0">How will he shrink when all his lewd allay</div>
  <div class="i0">And wicked mixture shall be purged away?</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the first edition of the Poem, this lumbering attack upon
Dryden concluded with a compliment:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">But what remains will be so pure, 'twill bear</div>
  <div class="i0">The examination of the most severe.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Blackmore, when our author had retaliated upon him in the Preface
to the Fables, "finding," says Dr Johnson, "the censure resented, and
the civility disregarded, ungenerously omitted the softer part. Such
variations discover a writer who consults his passions more than his
virtue, and it may be reasonably supposed that Dryden attributes his
enmity to its true cause,"&mdash;his attack upon Blackmore's fanatic
patrons in the city. He had also assailed our author in the Preface to
his "Prince Arthur;" which, after a general and bitter complaint of the
profligacy of the stage, contains these personal remarks levelled against
Dryden. "And there are, among these writers, some who think they might
have arisen to the highest dignities in other professions, had they
employed their wit in those ways. 'Tis a mighty dishonour and reproach
to any man, that is capable of being useful to the world in any liberal
or virtuous profession, to lavish out his life and wit in propagating
vice and corruption of manners, and in battering from the stage the
strongest entrenchments and best works of religion and virtue. Whoever
makes this his choice, when the other was in his power, may he go off the
stage unpitied, complaining of <em>neglect</em> and <em>poverty</em>,
the just punishment of his irreligion and folly." This reproach, which
touched some very tender points, was not to be tolerated or forgot by
Dryden.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> Blackmore was a commoner of Edmund Hall, Oxford, where
he remained thirteen years, and took the degree of Master of Arts
on 3d June, 1676; but he did not take his medical degrees there,
and appears not to have studied physic regularly, as he was for
some time a school-master; when, according to Col. Coddrington,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">

  <div class="i0">By nature formed, by want a pedant made,</div>
  <div class="i0">Blackmore at first set up the whipping trade;</div>

<p>Sir Richard Blackmore had his medical diploma from Padua,
in Italy; a learned and eminent University, which, like some in
my own country, is supposed not to be over scrupulous in conferring
honours of this nature.</p></div>

1695, was written, the author assures us in his Preface, "by such
catches and starts, and in such occasional uncertain hours, as his
profession afforded, and for the greatest part in coffee-houses, or
in passing up and down the streets."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_67_67" id="Footnote_67_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> Who was the first of these well-judging monarchs, is hard to
say. Blackmore may have had some sort of royal licence for the
practice of physic during the reign of Charles or James; but he
was not made physician to the Household till the reign of King
William, who conferred on him, at the same time, the honour of
knighthood; for which that monarch's taste is thus commemorated
by Pope:</p>

</div>

<p>Blackmore's dulness, or solidity of temper, rendered him absolutely
impenetrable to the shafts of ridicule, which were aimed
at him from all quarters; and, consoling himself with the excellence
of his intentions, he wrote on till the catalogue of his works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
gave room for Swift's burlesque inscription, to be placed under

Sir John Harrington gives the following extraordinary account of one
of King James's revels with Christian IV. of Denmark.&mdash;"One day a
great feast was held, and, after dinner, the representation of Solomon
his Temple, and the coming of the queen of Sheba, was made (or, as I
may better say) was meant to have been made, before their majesties, by
device of the earl of Salisbury and others. But, alas! as all earthly
things do fail to poor mortals in enjoyment, so did prove our presentment
hereof. The ladie, who did play the queen's part, did carry most precious
gifts to both their majesties; but, forgetting the steps arising to the
canopy, overset her caskets into his Danish majesties lap, and fell at
his feet, though I rather think it was in his face. Much was the hurry
and confusion; clothes and napkins were at hand to make all clean. His
majesty then got up, and would dance with the queen of Sheba, but he
fell down and humbled himself before her, and was carried to an inner
chamber, and laid upon a bed of state, which was not a little defiled
with the presents of the queen, which had been bestowed on his garments;
such as wine, cream, jelly, beverage, cakes, spices, and other good
matters. The entertainment and show <i>went forward</i>, and most of the
presenters <em>went backward</em>, or fell down: wine did so occupy
their upper chambers. Now did appear, in rich dresses, Hope, Faith, and
Charity: Hope did essay to speak, but wine rendered her endeavours so
feeble, that she withdrew, and <em>hoped</em> the king would excuse her
brevity: Faith was then left all alone, for I am certain she was not
joined with good works, and left the court in a staggering condition:
Charity came to the king's feet, and seemed to cover the multitude of
sins her sisters had committed; in some sort she made obeisance, and
brought gifts, but said she would return home again, as there was no gift
which heaven had not already given his majesty. She then returned to Hope
and Faith, who were both sick, and spewing in the lower hall. Next came
Victory, in bright armour, and presented a rich sword to the king, who
did not accept it, but put it by with his hand, and by a strange medley
of versification, did endeavour to make suit to the king. But Victory
did not triumph long; for, after much lamentable utterance, she was led
away like a silly captive, and laid to sleep on the outer steps of the
anti-chamber. Now did Peace make entry, and strove to get foremost to
the king; but I grieve to tell how great wrath she did discover unto
those of her attendants, and, much contrary to her semblance, most rudely
made war with her olive-branch, and laid on the pates of those who did
oppose her coming. I have much marvelled at these strange pageantries;
and they do bring to my remembrance what past of this sort in our
queen's days, of which I was sometime a humble presenter and assistant,
but I ne'er did see such lack of good order, discretion, and sobriety,
as I have now done. I have passed much time in seeing the royal sports
of hunting and hawking, where the manners were such as made me devise
the beasts were pursuing the sober creation, and not man, in quest of
exercise and food. I will now, in good sooth, declare to you, who will
not blab, that the gun-powder fright is got out of all our heads, and
we are going on hereabouts as if the devil was contriving every man
should blow up himself by wild riot, excess, and devastation of time and
temperance."&mdash;<cite>Ibid. Letter from Sir John Harrington to Mr

beautiful queen of James II., so much admired by the Tory poets
of the time.</p></div>

assigned another motive for this assault: "The clergy and the actors are
both moral menders by profession," said the wag; "and you know two of a
trade can never agree."&mdash;<cite>Cibber's Apology.</cite></p></div>

piece with their general hypocrisy. It was, however, carried much farther
in Scotland, where open adultery was declared by statute a capital crime.
That act is still unrepealed, and may remind the reader of a verse I have
somewhere read:</p>

  <div class="i0">Beware, ye knights on British ground,</div>
  <div class="i1">Beware, ye dames so free;</div>

he wished, though much better than he deserved. James II. by the extreme
cruelty of the punishment, which Jefferies doomed, and he suffered to be
inflicted, contrived to excite the public commiseration even in favour of
this miscreant, whose forsworn tongue had occasioned more murders than
the dagger of the most sanguinary bravo. After the Revolution he obtained
a pardon, or rather remission of his inhuman sentence, to be imprisoned
during life, and pilloried five times every year. He was also admitted
to the comforts of a pension of L.400 a-year. But, although he bestirred
himself to obtain a reversal of his judgement for perjury, and wrote
an abusive pamphlet, entitled, a "Picture of the late King James," and
dedicated to King William, that cool-headed monarch, and his sagacious
council, would never restore him to a capacity of bearing evidence. The
Earl of Danby, now Duke of Leeds, who had experienced the danger of his
swearing capacity, would consent to the reversal in no other sense, than
that, having been condemned to be scourged from Newgate to Tyburn, he
should now be scourged back from Tyburn to Newgate. Dryden, therefore,
without fear of offence, might venture a stroke of satire at this once
formidable person.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> The allusion seems to be partly to Bryan Haines, the Tory evidence
against Shaftesbury and College, a fellow almost as infamous as Oates;
but chiefly, by way of equivoque, to the wicked wag Jee Haines, the
comedian, who, amongst other pranks, chose, during the reign of James
II., to become Roman Catholic. Whether he took this step from any serious
prospect of advantage, or to throw ridicule on the new converts, is
somewhat dubious; at least his apostacy was not founded upon conviction
for, after the Revolution, he abjured the errors of Popery, spoke a
penitentiary prologue, and reconciled himself to the church and theatre
of England.</p></div>
